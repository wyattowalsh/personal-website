		<h3>Regularized Linear Regression Models</h3>
		<p><h4>Part Three of Three: Pathwise Coordinate Descent For the Lasso and the Elastic Net and Concluding Remarks</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cju3fHmuTtt5w4AFV7lfFg.png" /><figcaption>Model Coefficient Value Changes With Growing Regularization Penalty Values (<em>Image by¬†author)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hey there!¬†üëã</p><p>Welcome to the final part of a three-part deep-dive on <strong>regularized linear regression modeling</strong>! In<strong> </strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c"><strong>part one</strong></a>, linear modeling was established with the derivation of OLS showing how to solve for model coefficients to make predictions of the response given new feature data. Next, in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-44572e79a1b5"><strong>part two</strong></a>, <strong><em>overfitting </em></strong>issues of the OLS model were discussed and<strong><em> Ridge Regression </em></strong>was presented as a technique to help reduce overfitting through regularization. Building off the same concept as Ridge Regression,<strong><em> the Lasso</em></strong> and <strong><em>the Elastic Net </em></strong>are now presented. The series concludes with general considerations of use cases for the techniques presented.</p><p>The models and included implementations were tested on a wine quality prediction dataset of which the code and results can be viewed at the project repository <a href="http://github.com/wyattowalsh/regularized-linear-regression-deep-dive"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h3>The Lasso for Regression</h3><p>The Lasso, or <strong><em>Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator</em></strong>, includes the addition of an <strong><em>L‚ÇÅ</em></strong> penalty to the OLS loss function (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c">Part One</a>: Eq. #7), bringing selective model parameters to zero for a large enough value of an associated tuning parameter, <strong><em>Œª</em></strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong>In other words, <strong><em>the Lasso</em></strong> <strong>performs automated feature selection </strong>producing a vector of model coefficients with sparsity (amount of elements that are zero) varying on the magnitude of a tuning parameter.</p><p><strong><em>The Lasso</em></strong> loss function can be formalized as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/1*n6qJO9L9ZOaPfkbtzNcsMQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #1</figcaption></figure><p>Similar to previous cases, an intercept term can be included through data augmentation of the design matrix with a column of <strong>1</strong>s. Furthermore, formulating the problem as a <em>least-squares</em> optimization problem produces:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/528/1*B-Z2-_00fCCDq-dQNBlRpA.png" /><figcaption>Equation #2</figcaption></figure><p>However, unlike previous cases, no closed-form solution exists for this problem. This is due to the fact that the addition of the <strong><em>L‚ÇÅ</em></strong> penalty makes the function no longer continuously differentiable because of the non-smooth absolute component. To remedy this issue, a discrete optimization technique needs to be applied to search for an optimal solution.</p><p>Numerous algorithms exist to this end, such as<strong><em> LARS</em></strong> (Least Angle Regression) and <strong><em>Forward Stepwise Regression</em></strong>, however, the <strong><em>Pathwise Coordinate Descent</em></strong> algorithm is leveraged within this work. In short, this algorithm optimizes a parameter at a time holding all other parameters constant.</p><h4>Pathwise Coordinate Descent</h4><p>Before beginning the algorithm, all features should be standardized to have zero mean and variance of one. From there, a <strong><em>p+1</em></strong> length coefficient vector is initialized to zero. Cycles are then run across all coefficients until convergence‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhere values of the coefficients stabilize and do not change more than a certain tolerance‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis reached. Within each cycle, for every coefficient, an update is calculated and subsequently has the soft-thresholding operator applied to¬†it.</p><p>The simplest form of <strong><em>Coordinate Descent </em>updates </strong>calculates‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor each coefficient‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe simple (single variable as opposed to multiple regression) least-squares coefficient value using the partial residuals across all other features in the design matrix. Partial residuals, in this case, are found¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/216/1*EFiIYLkOAKwFeoEv38cj4Q.png" /><figcaption>Equation #3</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, the estimate for a particular coefficient value can be found¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/188/1*Tf7Lg7RyvsAy-Ez6R_rS5Q.png" /><figcaption>Equation #4</figcaption></figure><p>Now, the penalty, as dictated by the tuning parameter, is included in the model through the soft-thresholding operator. This is expressed as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*N02FKWLcTEdyS9tMg2sn1w.png" /><figcaption>Equation #5</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Naive updates</em></strong> can be utilized for improved efficiency. These updates are found¬†via:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/228/1*-9CpaMzXYs465_hSYhz64A.png" /><figcaption>Equation #6</figcaption></figure><p>where <strong><em>r·µ¢ </em></strong>is the current model residual for all samples,¬†<strong><em>n</em></strong>.</p><p>When the number of samples is much greater than the number of features (<strong><em>n</em></strong> &gt;&gt; <strong><em>p</em></strong>), further efficiency improvements can be derived by using <strong>covariance updates</strong>. For these updates, the first term of the <strong><em>Naive update</em></strong> equation above (Eq. #6) is replaced as shown¬†by:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/396/1*fjqGZtZM4up6crG8R-f-Og.png" /><figcaption>Equation #7</figcaption></figure><p>Utilizing <strong><em>warm starts</em></strong><em> </em>can bring efficiency boosts as well. Using <strong><em>warm starts</em></strong>, a sequence of models are fitted‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith tuning parameter values from a max tuning parameter value down to a minimum tuning parameter value that is some small factor (thousandth) of the max value‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinitializing the coefficients of each iteration to the solution of the last iteration. In many cases, it is actually faster to fit this path of models than a single model for some small <strong><em>Œª. </em></strong>Thus the path can be expressed as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/244/1*L8Q-Pg_7oaGJ1i_V14bpcQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #8</figcaption></figure><p>where <strong><em>ùúñ </em></strong>is typically 0.001 and there are 100 values spaced on a log¬†scale.</p><p>Furthermore, the max value of the tuning parameter to begin the path at can be found by finding the minimum value that will bring the estimates for all model coefficients to zero. This is since any values above this value will result in total sparsity of the coefficient vector. The max value of the path (starting point) can be found¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/220/1*aFx9cbsJ23otuk1SYNLo6A.png" /><figcaption>Equation #9</figcaption></figure><p>By providing a starting place to begin searching for optimality, warm starting can many times speed up convergence and also puts the <em>pathwise</em> in the <strong><em>Pathwise</em> <em>Coordinate Descent</em></strong> algorithm.</p><h4>Implementation of the Lasso In Python Using¬†NumPy</h4><p>One possible way to implement <strong><em>pathwise coordinate descen</em></strong>t for <strong><em>the Lasso </em></strong>(with options for tuning the convergence tolerance, path length, and returning the path)¬†is:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/6a17e79eaf5822803154eef272588c34/href">https://medium.com/media/6a17e79eaf5822803154eef272588c34/href</a></iframe><h3>The Elastic¬†Net</h3><p>In this form of regularized linear regression, the OLS loss function is changed by the addition of both an <strong><em>L‚ÇÅ </em></strong>and <strong><em>L‚ÇÇ</em></strong> penalty to the loss function with tuning parameters controlling the intensity of regularization and the balance between the different penalties. This loss function can be formalized as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/868/1*2XfDiqMRQW4A4FPanjtDbQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #10</figcaption></figure><p>Having both <strong><em>L‚ÇÅ </em></strong>and <strong><em>L‚ÇÇ</em></strong> penalties, <strong><em>the Elastic Net</em></strong> serves to deliver a compromise between Ridge regression and the Lasso, bringing coefficients towards zero and selectively to zero.

		<h3>Regularized Linear Regression Models</h3>
		<p><h4>Part Two of Three: Drawbacks of <strong><em>Ordinary Least Squares</em></strong> (OLS), Possible Remedies, and <strong>Ridge Regression</strong></h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cju3fHmuTtt5w4AFV7lfFg.png" /><figcaption>Model Coefficient Value Changes With Growing Regularization Penalty Values (<em>Image by¬†author)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello again and hopefully welcome back¬†üëã</p><p>In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c">the last part </a>of this three-part deep-dive exploration into<strong> regularized linear regression </strong>modeling techniques, several topics were covered: the equation between the response and feature variables underlying linear regression models, the sum of squared error (SSE) loss function, the O<strong><em>rdinary Least Squares </em></strong>(OLS) model, and the necessary optimization steps to find an OLS model estimator that can be trained on sample data to produce predictions of a response given new feature¬†data.</p><p>Moving forward, in this part, drawbacks of OLS, potential remedies, and the<strong> <em>Ridge Regression</em> </strong>model will be discussed.</p><p>Similar to the last part, all implementations suggested here were validated on a wine quality prediction dataset that, along with other related files, can be found at the project‚Äôs repository, <a href="http://github.com/wyattowalsh/regularized-linear-regression-deep-dive"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h4>Drawbacks of¬†OLS</h4><p>As is with most things, there are tradeoffs that have to made when modeling. One such major tradeoff is that of the <strong>bias-variance tradeoff. </strong>Any model‚Äôs error can be broken down into two components: bias and variance. Bias can be considered the error implicit in the modeling algorithm, whereas variance can be considered the error derived from differences in idiosyncrasies across training datasets. A good model is one that should have the overall error minimized, thus both bias and variance should be minimized. However, there is a tradeoff to consider as increasing bias will often decrease variance.</p><p>For the OLS model, a high variance is a concern. Since the SSE is being optimized, the model tends to fit outlier data points since they will produce higher error values due to the squared term within the loss function. By fitting these outlier points, the OLS model can subsequently base predictions off modeled patterns that are only present in the training data‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääidiosyncratic outlying points‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand not representative of the entire population. This phenomenon is called <strong><em>overfitting</em></strong> and can lead to predictive models with low accuracy when generalizing to new predictions.</p><p>Since OLS is a low bias model, it is well-suited to have its variance lowered through bias addition, which may result in higher overall predictive ability. One way to add bias is through <strong>shrinkage</strong>, biasing model coefficient estimates toward zero. This shrinkage can be achieved through the addition of a <strong>regularization penalty </strong>to the loss function which applies a unique form of shrinkage to the overall coefficient estimates.</p><p>In the next section, I‚Äôll cover <strong><em>Ridge Regression‚Ää</em>‚Äî‚Ää</strong>regularization by the addition of a tuning parameter (Œª) coefficient controlled <strong><em>L‚ÇÇ</em></strong> penalty to the OLS loss function.</p><blockquote>Make sure to check out the next and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-dcf5aa662ab9">final part of the series</a><strong> </strong>to learn about the other two forms of regularized linear regression, <strong>the Lasso</strong> and <strong>the Elastic¬†Net.</strong></blockquote><h3>Ridge Regression</h3><p>This form of regression is also known as <strong><em>Tikhonov Regularization </em></strong>and modifies the OLS loss function (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c">Part One</a>: Eq. #7) with the addition of an <strong><em>L‚ÇÇ</em></strong> penalty with an associated tuning parameter, <strong><em>Œª</em></strong>. This loss function can be described using vector notation¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/1*BYgPXXS1fHgFUVKZQej6MA.png" /><figcaption>Equation #1</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly to the OLS case, this loss function can then be formulated as a <em>least-squares </em>optimization problem to find estimates for the model coefficients that minimize the loss function¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/532/1*-MS_E_A7aT_U-3wPqQK5Pw.png" /><figcaption>Equation #2</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the OLS case, a 1/(2n) term is added in order to simply solving the gradient and allow the objective function to converge to the expected value of the model error by <strong>the Law of Large¬†Numbers</strong>.</p><p>This problem is also unconstrained and a closed-form solution for <strong>the Ridge estimator</strong> can be found by setting the gradient of the loss function (objective) equal to zero and solving the resultant equation. This produces an estimator result¬†of:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/252/1*2wlXh_tx5RcZyYvVX5DSNA.png" /><figcaption>Equation #3</figcaption></figure><p>This estimator should also be shown to be unique. In this case, the associated <strong><em>Hessian</em></strong> matrix¬†is:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/192/1*Ll-vX-C8GD2um5ZCkdknYg.png" /><figcaption>Equation #4</figcaption></figure><p>It turns out that this matrix can be shown to be <strong>positive definite</strong>¬†by:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/732/1*GdZ5Gy7DEtfBTcJQyAKakg.png" /><figcaption>Equation #5</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, since the associated Hessian matrix of the Ridge loss function is positive definite, the function is strongly convex, which implies that the Ridge estimator (Eq. #3) is the <strong>unique</strong> global minimizer to the <strong><em>Ridge Regression</em></strong> problem.</p><p>Implementations of the estimator can be simplified by noticing that the problem can be reformulated as an OLS problem through <strong>data augmentation</strong>. This would take the form¬†of:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*V0A1Ci1XCkDxcqKBa8pjiA.png" /><figcaption>Equation #6</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, by utilizing the above data augmentation the same result as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c">Equation #9 from the last part of this series</a> can be used to solve for the coefficient estimates. That result is reproduced here:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/224/1*9J0ge0zzhKK6PrbF02x5nQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #7</figcaption></figure><h4>Implementing the Estimator Using Python and¬†NumPy</h4><p>Similar to the OLS case, the matrix inverse does not scale well, thus the NumPy function solve, which employs the LAPACK <em>_gesv</em> routine, is used to find the least-squares solution. This function solves the equation in the case where A is square and full-rank (linearly independent columns). However, in the case that A is not full-rank, then the function lstsq should be used, which utilizes the xGELSD routine and thus finds the singular value decomposition of¬†A.</p><p>One possible Python implementation of <strong><em>Ridge Regression</em></strong> with an optional intercept term¬†is:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/0b41872848020b8c372ce47012744a02/href">https://medium.com/media/0b41872848020b8c372ce47012744a02/href</a></iframe><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Thanks for reading part two of <strong><em>Regularized Linear Regression Models</em></strong>!¬†üôå</p><p>If you have not already, make sure to check out <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-57bbdce90a8c"><strong>part¬†one</strong>!</a></p><p>Continue on to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-dcf5aa662ab9"><strong>part three</strong></a><strong> </strong>to learn about <strong><em>the Lasso</em> </strong>and <strong><em>the Elastic Net</em></strong>, the last two regularized linear regression techniques!</p><p>See <a href="https://github.com/wyattowalsh/regularized-linear-regression-deep-dive/blob/master/SOURCES.md"><strong>here</strong></a> for the different sources utilized to create this series of¬†posts.</p><p>Please leave a comment if you would like!

		<h3>Regularized Linear Regression Models</h3>
		<p><h4>Part One of Three: Introduction, Linear Regression Modeling, and Ordinary Least Squares¬†(OLS)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cju3fHmuTtt5w4AFV7lfFg.png" /><figcaption>Model Coefficient Value Changes With Growing Regularization Penalty Values (<em>Image by¬†author)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hey üëã</p><p>Welcome to part one of a three-part deep-dive on <strong>regularized linear regression modeling‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää</strong>some of the most popular algorithms for supervised learning¬†tasks<strong>.</strong></p><p>Before hopping into the equations and code, let us first discuss what will be covered in this¬†series.</p><p><strong>Part one </strong>will include an introductory discussion about regression, an explanation of linear regression modeling, and a presentation of the <strong><em>Ordinary Least Squares</em> </strong>(OLS) model (from the derivation of the model estimator using applied optimization theory through the implementation of the findings in Python using¬†NumPy).</p><p>Drawbacks of the OLS model and some possible remedies will be discussed in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-44572e79a1b5"><strong>part two</strong></a>. One such remedy, <strong><em>Ridge Regression</em></strong>, will be presented here with an explanation including the derivation of its model estimator and NumPy implementation in¬†Python.</p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/regularized-linear-regression-models-dcf5aa662ab9"><strong>Part three</strong></a><strong> </strong>will conclude this series of posts with explanations of<strong> </strong>the remaining regularized linear models: <strong><em>the Lasso</em> </strong>and <strong><em>the Elastic Net</em></strong>. Solving these models is more complicated than in previous cases since a discrete optimization technique is needed. The cause of this complication, the <em>Pathwise Coordinate Descent </em>algorithm along with its NumPy-based Python implementation, and some concluding remarks are given in this¬†post.</p><p>The models and included implementations were tested on a wine quality prediction dataset of which the code and results can be viewed at the project repository <a href="http://github.com/wyattowalsh/regularized-linear-regression-deep-dive"><strong>here</strong></a></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Managerial decision making, organizational efficiency, and revenue generation are all areas that can be improved through the utilization of data-based insights. Currently, these insights are being more readily sought out as technological accessibility stretches further and competitive advantages in the market are harder to acquire. One field that seeks to realize value within collected data samples is predictive analytics. By leveraging mathematical/statistical techniques and programming, practitioners are able to identify patterns within data allowing for the generation of valuable insights.</p><p><strong><em>Regression</em></strong> is one technique within predictive analytics that is used to predict the value of a continuous response variable given one or many related feature variables. Algorithms of this class accomplish this task by learning the relationships between the input (feature) variables and the output (response) variable through training on a sample dataset. How these relationships are learned, and furthermore used for prediction varies from algorithm to algorithm. The practitioner is faced with options for regression modeling algorithms, however, linear regression models tend to be explored early on in the process due to their ease of application and high explainability.</p><h3>Linear Regression Modeling</h3><p>A linear regression model learns the input-output relationships by fitting a linear function to the sample data. This can be mathematically formalized as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-mNqFuCYxsd5V-4iXhhf1A.png" /><figcaption>Equation #1</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, the response is modeled as a weighted sum of the input variables multiplied by linear coefficients with an error term included. It will prove useful in future steps involving optimization to use vector notation. The linear modeling equation can be expressed this way¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyVuwzY3CjR6-02BzYYkBw.png" /><figcaption>Equation #2</figcaption></figure><p>An important aspect of the above equation to note is that there is a column of <strong>1</strong>‚Äôs appended to the design matrix. This is such that the first coefficient of the coefficient vector can serve as an intercept term. In cases where an intercept is not sought after this column can be¬†omitted.</p><p>Thus the goal of model training is to find an estimate of the coefficient vector, <strong><em>Œ≤ÃÇ, </em></strong>which can then be utilized with the above equations to make predictions of the response given new feature data. This can be accomplished by applying optimization theory to the model equations above to derive an equation for the model coefficient estimator that minimizes a notion of model error found by training on the sample¬†data.</p><h4>Minimizing a Notion of Model¬†Error</h4><p>To consider how model error can be minimized, a consideration of model error must first be made. Prediction error for a single prediction can be expressed as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9vEjdXmGaIZEcNd05V6LJw.png" /><figcaption>Equation #3</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, in vector notation, total model error across all predictions can be found¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/1*uCfmafhvNzFh-DVtabK5Ow.png" /><figcaption>Equation #4</figcaption></figure><p>However, for the uses of finding a minimal overall model error, the <strong><em>L‚ÇÇ</em></strong> norm above is not a good objective function. This is due to the fact that negative errors and positive errors will cancel out, thus a minimization will find an objective value of zero even though in reality the model error is much¬†higher.</p><p>This signed error cancellation issue can be solved by squaring the model‚Äôs prediction error producing the sum of squared error (SSE)¬†term:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/376/1*F6kywmhTdtdO9jdlDMV4nw.png" /><figcaption>Equation #5</figcaption></figure><p>This same term can be expressed in vector notation¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/240/1*aI5pkAoiEMATRjC3WgNx7Q.png" /><figcaption>Equation #6</figcaption></figure><p>As will be seen in future optimization applications, this function is much better suited to serve as a <strong>loss function</strong>, a function minimized that aptly models the error for a given technique.<strong> </strong>Many different models other than regularized linear models use the SSE error term as a term in their respective loss functions.</p><h3><strong>Ordinary Least¬†Squares</strong></h3><p>Now that linear modeling and error has been covered, we can move on to the most simple linear regression model, <strong><em>Ordinary Least Squares</em></strong> (OLS). In this case, the simple SSE error term is the model‚Äôs loss function and can be expressed as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/324/1*uRoHZOW3Y5tMltkfSldT7w.png" /><figcaption>Equation #7</figcaption></figure><p>Using this loss function, the problem can now be formalized as a <em>least-squares </em>optimization problem. This problem serves to derive estimates for the model parameters, <strong><em>Œ≤</em></strong>, that minimize the SSE between the actual and predicted values of the outcome and is formalized as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/440/1*_TrQb8nOOANLCti93ydumg.png" /><figcaption>Equation #8</figcaption></figure><p>The 1/(2n) term is added in order to simply solving the gradient and allow the objective function to converge to the expected value of the model error by <strong>the Law of Large¬†Numbers</strong>.</p><p>Aided by the problem‚Äôs unconstrained nature, a closed-form solution for the OLS estimator can be obtained by setting the gradient of the loss function (objective) equal to zero and solving the resultant equation for the coefficient vector, <strong><em>Œ≤ÃÇ. </em></strong>This produces the following estimator:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/224/1*9J0ge0zzhKK6PrbF02x5nQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #9</figcaption></figure><p>However, this may not be the only optimal estimator, thus its uniqueness should be proven. To do this, it will suffice to show that the loss function (Eq. #8) is convex since any local optimality of a convex function is also global optimality and therefore unique.</p><p>One possible way to show this is through the second-order convexity conditions, which state that a function is convex if it is continuous, twice differentiable, and has an associated Hessian matrix that is positive semi-definite. Due to its quadratic nature, the OLS loss function (Eq. #8) is both continuous and twice differentiable, satisfying the first two conditions.</p><p>To establish the last condition, the OLS Hessian matrix is found¬†as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/124/1*mmRm7_x5xCuUFkfbqxD7wg.png" /><figcaption>Equation #10</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, this Hessian can be shown to be positive semi-definite as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/504/1*xmTZLUJYNwqz2mxGmwhYLQ.png" /><figcaption>Equation #11</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, by the second-order conditions for convexity, the OLS loss function (Eq. #8) is convex, thus the estimator found above (Eq #9) is the <strong><em>unique</em></strong> global minimizer to the OLS¬†problem.</p><h4>Implementing the Estimator Using Python and¬†NumPy</h4><p>Solving for the OLS estimator using the matrix inverse does not scale well, thus the NumPy function solve, which employs the LAPACK <em>_gesv</em> routine, is used to find the least-squares solution.
