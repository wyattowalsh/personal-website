  <h1> Hi there! &#128075; </h1>
  <p align="left"> My name is Wyatt Walsh. I grew up in Eastern California sort of near Death Valley in a rural town of fewer than 500 people, spent a few years in Connecticut at boarding school to earn my high school diploma, and then returned to the West Coast for my undergraduate work at UC Berkeley. </p>

<p>At Berkeley (Go Bears! &#128059;), I studied Industrial Engineering and Operations Research where I learned to solve a variety of industrial problems leveraging optimization and applied mathematics. My coursework can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/coursework"><b>here</b></a>. </p>

<p>I am deeply interested in data science, optimization, mathematical programming, forecasting, machine learning, artifical intelligence and similar fields. More details on my skills can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/skills"><b>here</b></a>.</p> 

<p>Whether it was growing up in the beautiful Eastern Sierras in California, seemingly always finding solace in a nice view and quiet space, or, almost antithetically, being a large proponent of adrenaline, I certainly have grown a love for getting outside. I enjoy mountain biking,  playing frisbee (ultimate and golf &#129359;), and hiking, but I'm almost always down to try a new sport or activity.</p>

<p>Music also makes up a huge aspect of my life and I do quite a few music related activities. I make attempts at music production mostly focused within the harder electronic music genres and within that area, mostly on hardstyle. I'm a hobbyist DJ and tend to play electronic music (harder dance, big room house, psytrance, dubstep, melodic/deep house, and others &#127925;) with some hip-hop, rap, hard rock, or alternative songs thrown in occasionally. I probably waste too much money on live music events, but nevertheless they're awesome and wonderful opportunities to catch original sounds from pros (which can be learned from for future production or DJ sessions &#127911;) in a fun environment with friends. I also spend a significant chunk of time building musical playlists by genre, time period, style, and other patterns to make better sense of the ridiculously large body of music now easily accessible.</p> 

<p> I certainly enjoy meeting new people and developing personal, professional, or other synergies &mdash; reach out if you would like (email or LinkedIn is best &#128522;)!!
