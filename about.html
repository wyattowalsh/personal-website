    <p> Hi there! </p>

<div class="text">
<p align="left"> My name is Wyatt Walsh. I grew up in Eastern California sort of near Death Valley in a rural town of fewer than 500 people, spent a few years in Connecticut at boarding school to earn my high school diploma, and then returned to the West Coast for my undergraduate work at UC Berkeley. </p>
<br> 
<p>At Berkeley, I studied Industrial Engineering and Operations Research where I learned to solve a variety of industrial problems leveraging optimization and applied mathematics. I am deeply interested in data science, optimization, mathematical programming, forecasting, and similar fields. </p>
<p>Reach out to me via any of my contacts (found in the sidebar)! </p>
