Game data, including attendance, was scraped from stats.nba.com and stadium capacity data collected from numerous online sources. This data was then cleaned, processed, explored through visualizations and statistical tests, and then modeled using many regression techniques including regularized methods, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, and neural networks.</description></item></channel></rss>
