Explanation of notation used:

- ★☆☆☆☆ (1 star): Introductory knowledge (i.e. understand skill's role and purpose but with little to no experience)

- ★★☆☆☆ (2 stars): Significant knowledge of skill, but little applied experience (i.e. only written a few scripts to understand possible future implementation and usage)

- ★★★☆☆ (3 stars): Knowledge and experience (i.e. skill was used as an ancillary role to a project)

- ★★★★☆ (4 stars): Knowledge and significant experience (i.e. skill was focus of an extended project).

- ★★★★★ (5 stars): Created or conducted significant applied research in the area or repeated experience over time
