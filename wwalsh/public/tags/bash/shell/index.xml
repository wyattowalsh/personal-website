Game data, including attendance, was scraped from stats.nba.com and stadium capacity data collected from numerous online sources. This data was then cleaned, processed, explored through visualizations and statistical tests, and then modeled using many regression techniques including regularized methods, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, and neural networks.</description></item><item><title>Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Fair Division Problems</title><link>https://wwalsh.io/projects/creations/mixed-integer-linear-programming-for-fair-division-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 15:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wwalsh.io/projects/creations/mixed-integer-linear-programming-for-fair-division-problems/</guid><description>The goal of this project is to find optimally fair allocations of divisible and non-divisible goods for a group of people under three different definitions of fairness under envy-freeness with certain assumptions. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations are created in AMPL and solved using CPLEX resulting in the generation of datasets consisting of the minimal approximate envy value and solver elapsed time for different combinations of number of people and number of goods.</description></item></channel></rss>
