Ensured $0 capital overhead requirements by using free cloud computing and dataset tools. Enabled better testing, deployment, and expansion by containerizing each pipeline segment’s Python scripts.</description></item><item><title> Machine Learning for NBA Game Attendance Prediction</title><link>https://wwalsh.io/projects/creations/nba-attendance-prediction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 15:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wwalsh.io/projects/creations/nba-attendance-prediction/</guid><description>The goal of this project was to craft models in order to accurately predict the attendance of a future National Basketball Association (NBA) game. Game data, including attendance, was scraped from stats.nba.com and stadium capacity data collected from numerous online sources. This data was then cleaned, processed, explored through visualizations and statistical tests, and then modeled using many regression techniques including regularized methods, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, and neural networks.</description></item></channel></rss>
