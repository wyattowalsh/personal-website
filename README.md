## Technical Information

This site is a static site built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). 

I utilize the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme with custom coloring and several plugins: 
- [jekyll-display-medium-posts](https://github.com/jameshamann/jekyll-display-medium-posts)
- [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
- [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)

I also embed **_Spotify_**, **_Flickr_**, and **_Twitter_** media into my homepage as well include social media links across a multitude of different platforms with icons in the sidebar. Also in the sidebar, I redirect to my my other site: [MakeUseofData.com](https://makeuseofdata.com). 

Reach out if you would any help in building a similar site or using similar features!
