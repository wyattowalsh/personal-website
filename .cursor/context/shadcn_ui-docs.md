This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files, combined into a single document by Repomix.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: apps/v4/content/docs/**/*.md, apps/v4/content/docs/**/*.mdx, apps/v4/content/docs/**/*.rst
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

title: Blocks
description: Contribute components to the blocks library.
---

We are inviting the community to contribute to the [blocks library](/blocks). Share your components and blocks with other developers and help build a library of high-quality, reusable components.

We'd love to see all types of blocks: applications, marketing, products, and more.

## Setup your workspace

<Steps>

### Fork the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui.git
```

### Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b username/my-new-block
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm www:dev
```

</Steps>

## Add a block

A block can be a single component (eg. a variation of a ui component) or a complex component (eg. a dashboard) with multiple components, hooks, and utils.

<Steps>

### Create a new block

Create a new folder in the `apps/www/registry/new-york/blocks` directory. Make sure the folder is named in kebab-case and under `new-york`.

```txt
apps
└── www
    └── registry
        └── new-york
            └── blocks
                └── dashboard-01
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** The build script will take care of building the block for the `default` style.

</Callout>

### Add your block files

Add your files to the block folder. Here is an example of a block with a page, components, hooks, and utils.

```txt
dashboard-01
└── page.tsx
└── components
    └── hello-world.tsx
    └── example-card.tsx
└── hooks
    └── use-hello-world.ts
└── lib
    └── format-date.ts
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** You can start with one file and add more files later.

</Callout>

</Steps>

## Add your block to the registry

<Steps>

### Add your block definition to `registry-blocks.tsx`

To add your block to the registry, you need to add your block definition to `registry-blocks.ts`.

This follows the registry schema at [https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json](https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json).

```tsx title="apps/www/registry/registry-blocks.tsx" showLineNumbers
export const blocks = [
  // ...
  {
    name: "dashboard-01",
    author: "shadcn (https://ui.shadcn.com)",
    title: "Dashboard",
    description: "A simple dashboard with a hello world component.",
    type: "registry:block",
    registryDependencies: ["input", "button", "card"],
    dependencies: ["zod"],
    files: [
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/page.tsx",
        type: "registry:page",
        target: "app/dashboard/page.tsx",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/components/hello-world.tsx",
        type: "registry:component",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/components/example-card.tsx",
        type: "registry:component",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/hooks/use-hello-world.ts",
        type: "registry:hook",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/lib/format-date.ts",
        type: "registry:lib",
      },
    ],
    categories: ["dashboard"],
  },
]
```

Make sure you add a name, description, type, registryDependencies, dependencies, files, and categories. We'll go over each of these in more detail in the schema docs (coming soon).

### Run the build script

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** you do not need to run this script for every change. You only need to run it when you update the block definition.

</Callout>

### View your block

Once the build script is finished, you can view your block at `http://localhost:3333/blocks/[CATEGORY]` or a full screen preview at `http://localhost:3333/view/styles/new-york/dashboard-01`.

<Image
  src="/images/block-preview-light.png"
  width="1432"
  height="960"
  alt="Block preview"
  className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
/>
<Image
  src="/images/block-preview-dark.png"
  width="1432"
  height="960"
  alt="Block preview"
  className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
/>

### Build your block

You can now build your block by editing the files in the block folder and viewing the changes in the browser.

If you add more files, make sure to add them to the `files` array in the block definition.

</Steps>

## Publish your block

Once you're ready to publish your block, you can submit a pull request to the main repository.

<Steps>

### Run the build script

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

### Capture a screenshot

```bash
pnpm registry:capture
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** If you've run the capture script before, you might need to delete the existing screenshots (both light and dark) at `apps/www/public/r/styles/new-york` and run the script again.

</Callout>

### Submit a pull request

Commit your changes and submit a pull request to the main repository.

Your block will be reviewed and merged. Once merged it will be published to the website and available to be installed via the CLI.

</Steps>

## Categories

The `categories` property is used to organize your block in the registry.

### Add a category

If you need to add a new category, you can do so by adding it to the `registryCategories` array in `apps/www/registry/registry-categories.ts`.

```tsx title="apps/www/registry/registry-categories.ts" showLineNumbers
export const registryCategories = [
  // ...
  {
    name: "Input",
    slug: "input",
    hidden: false,
  },
]
```

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to the blocks library.

- The following properties are required for the block definition: `name`, `description`, `type`, `files`, and `categories`.
- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in `registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg. `input`, `button`, `card`, etc.
- Make sure to list all dependencies in `dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg. `zod`, `sonner`, etc.
- If your block has a page (optional), it should be the first entry in the `files` array and it should have a `target` property. This helps the CLI place the page in the correct location for file-based routing.
- **Imports should always use the `@/registry` path.** eg. `import { Input } from "@/registry/new-york/input"`

## May 2025 - New Site

We've upgraded [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) to Next.js 15.3 and Tailwind v4. The site now uses the upgraded `new-york` components.

We've also made some minor design updates to make the site faster and easier to navigate.

This upgrade unlocks a lot of new features that we're working on. More to come.

## April 2025 - MCP

We're working on zero-config MCP support for shadcn/ui registry. One command `npx shadcn registry:mcp` to make any registry mcp-compatible.

<Image
  src="/images/mcp.jpeg"
  width="1432"
  height="1050"
  alt="Lift Mode"
  className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border"
/>

Learn more in the thread here: https://x.com/shadcn/status/1917597228513853603

## March 2025 - shadcn 2.5.0

We tagged shadcn 2.5.0 earlier this week. It comes with a pretty cool feature: **resolve anywhere**.

Registries can now place files anywhere in an app and we’ll properly resolve imports. No need to stick to a fixed file structure. It can even add files outside the registry itself.

On install, we track all files and perform a multi-pass resolution to correctly handle imports and aliases. It’s fast.

## March 2025 - Cross-framework Route Support

The shadcn CLI can now auto-detect your framework and adapts routes for you.

Works with all frameworks including Laravel, Vite and React Router.

## February 2025 - Tailwind v4

We shipped the first preview of Tailwind v4 and React 19. Ready for you to try out. You can start using it today.

What's New:

- The CLI can now initialize projects with Tailwind v4.
- Full support for the new @theme directive and @theme inline option.
- All components are updated for Tailwind v4 and React 19.
- We’ve removed the forwardRefs and adjusted the types.
- Every primitive now has a data-slot attribute for styling.
- We've fixed and cleaned up the style of the components.
- We're deprecating the toast component in favor of sonner.
- Buttons now use the default cursor.
- We're deprecating the default style. New projects will use new-york.
- HSL colors are now converted to OKLCH.

Read more in the [docs](/docs/tailwind-v4).

## February 2025 - Updated Registry Schema

We're updating the registry schema to support more features.

Define code as a flat JSON file and distribute it via the CLI.

- Custom styles: bring your own design system, components & tokens
- Extend, override, mix & match components from third-party registries and LLMs
- Install themes, CSS vars, hooks, animations, and Tailwind layers & utilities

## January 2025 - Blocks

We are inviting the community to contribute to the blocks library. Share your components and blocks with other developers and help build a library of high-quality, reusable components.

We'd love to see all types of blocks: applications, marketing, products, and more.

See the [docs](/docs/blocks) page to get started.

## December 2024 - Monorepo Support

Until now, using shadcn/ui in a monorepo was a bit of a pain. You could add
components using the CLI, but you had to manage where the components
were installed and manually fix import paths.

With the new monorepo support in the CLI, we've made it a lot easier to use
shadcn/ui in a monorepo.

The CLI now understands the monorepo structure and will install the components,
dependencies and registry dependencies to the correct paths and handle imports
for you.

Read more in the [docs](/docs/monorepo).

## November 2024 - Icons

An update on icons. The new-york style now uses Lucide as the default icon set.

- New projects will use Lucide by default
- No breaking changes for existing projects
- Use the CLI to (optionally) migrate primitives to Lucide

For more info on why we're doing this, see the [thread](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1853902179041702169).

## October 2024 - React 19

shadcn/ui is now compatible with React 19 and Next.js 15.

We published a guide to help you upgrade your project to React 19.

Read more [here](/docs/react-19).

## October 2024 - Sidebar

Introducing sidebar.tsx: 25 components to help you build all kinds of sidebars.

I don't like building sidebars. So I built 30+ of them. All types. Then simplified the core into sidebar.tsx: a strong foundation to build on top of.

It works with Next.js, Remix, Vite & Laravel.

See the announcement [here](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1847359896557408461).

## August 2024 - npx shadcn init

The new CLI is now available. It's a complete rewrite with a lot of new features and improvements. You can now install components, themes, hooks, utils and more using `npx shadcn add`.

This is a major step towards distributing code that you and your LLMs can access and use.

1. First up, the cli now has support for all major React framework out of the box. Next.js, Remix, Vite and Laravel. And when you init into a new app, we update your existing Tailwind files instead of overriding.
2. A component now ship its own dependencies. Take the accordion for example, it can define its Tailwind keyframes. When you add it to your project, we’ll update your tailwind.config.ts file accordingly.
3. You can also install remote components using url. `npx shadcn add https://acme.com/registry/navbar.json`.
4. We have also improve the init command. It does framework detection and can even init a brand new Next.js app in one command. `npx shadcn init`.
5. We have created a new schema that you can use to ship your own component registry. And since it has support for urls, you can even use it to distribute private components.
6. And a few more updates like better error handling and monorepo support.

You can try the new cli today.

```bash
npx shadcn init sidebar-01 login-01
```

### Update Your Project

To update an existing project to use the new CLI, update your `components.json` file to include import aliases for your **components**, **utils**, **ui**, **lib** and **hooks**.

```json showLineNumbers {7-13} title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "tailwind": {
    // ...
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  }
}
```

If you're using a different import alias prefix eg `~`, replace `@` with your prefix.

## April 2024 - Introducing Lift Mode

We're introducing a new mode for [Blocks](/blocks) called **Lift Mode**.

Enable Lift Mode to automatically "lift" smaller components from a block template for copy and paste.

<a href="/blocks">
  <Image
    src="/images/lift-mode-light.png"
    width="1432"
    height="1050"
    alt="Lift Mode"
    className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
  />
  <Image
    src="/images/lift-mode-dark.png"
    width="1432"
    height="1069"
    alt="Lift Mode"
    className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

With Lift Mode, you'll be able to copy the smaller components that make up a block template, like cards, buttons, and forms, and paste them directly into your project.

Visit the [Blocks](/blocks) page to try it out.

## March 2024 - Introducing Blocks

One of the most requested features since launch has been layouts: admin dashboards with sidebar, marketing page sections, cards and more.

**Today, we're launching [**Blocks**](/blocks)**.

<a href="/blocks">
  <Image
    src="/images/dashboard-1.jpg"
    width="716"
    height="430"
    alt="Admin dashboard"
    className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
  />
  <Image
    src="/images/dashboard-1-dark.jpg"
    width="716"
    height="430"
    alt="Admin dashboard"
    className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

Blocks are ready-made components that you can use to build your apps. They are fully responsive, accessible, and composable, meaning they are built using the same principles as the rest of the components in shadcn/ui.

We're starting with dashboard layouts and authentication pages, with plans to add more blocks in the coming weeks.

### Open Source

Blocks are open source. You can find the source on GitHub. Use them in your projects, customize them and contribute back.

<a href="/blocks">
  <Image
    src="/images/dashboard-2.jpg"
    width="716"
    height="420"

    alt="AI Playground"
    className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

### Request a Block

We're also introducing a "Request a Block" feature. If there's a specific block you'd like to see, simply create a request on GitHub and the community can upvote and build it.

<a href="/blocks">
  <Image
    src="/images/dashboard-3.jpg"
    width="716"
    height="420"
    alt="Settings Page"
    className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
  />
  <Image
    src="/images/dashboard-3-dark.jpg"
    width="716"
    height="420"
    alt="Settings Page"
    className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
  />
  <span className="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

### v0

If you have a [v0](https://v0.dev) account, you can use the **Edit in v0** feature to open the code on v0 for prompting and further generation.

<div className="bg-background mt-6 flex aspect-video w-full items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm">

  </svg>
</div>

That's it. _Looking forward to seeing what you build with Blocks_.

## March 2024 - Breadcrumb and Input OTP

We've added a new Breadcrumb component and an Input OTP component.

### Breadcrumb

An accessible and flexible breadcrumb component. It has support for collapsed items, custom separators, bring-your-own routing `<Link />` and composable with other shadcn/ui components.

<ComponentPreview name="breadcrumb-demo" />

[See more examples](/docs/components/breadcrumb)

### Input OTP

A fully featured input OTP component. It has support for numeric and alphanumeric codes, custom length, copy-paste and accessible. Input OTP is built on top of [input-otp](https://github.com/guilhermerodz/input-otp) by [@guilherme_rodz](https://twitter.com/guilherme_rodz).

<ComponentPreview name="input-otp-demo" />

[Read the docs](/docs/components/input-otp)

If you have a [v0](https://v0.dev), the new components are available for generation.

## December 2023 - New components, CLI and more

We've added new components to shadcn/ui and made a lot of improvements to the CLI.

Here's a quick overview of what's new:

- [**Carousel**](#carousel) - A carousel component with motion, swipe gestures and keyboard support.
- [**Drawer**](#drawer) - A drawer component that looks amazing on mobile.
- [**Pagination**](#pagination) - A pagination component with page navigation, previous and next buttons.
- [**Resizable**](#resizable) - A resizable component for building resizable panel groups and layouts.
- [**Sonner**](#sonner) - The last toast component you'll ever need.
- [**CLI updates**](#cli-updates) - Support for custom **Tailwind prefix** and `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Carousel

We've added a fully featured carousel component with motion, swipe gestures and keyboard support. Built on top of [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com).

It has support for infinite looping, autoplay, vertical orientation, and more.

<ComponentPreview name="carousel-demo" />

### Drawer

Oh the drawer component 😍. Built on top of [Vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul) by [emilkowalski\_](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_).

Try opening the following drawer on mobile. It looks amazing!

<ComponentPreview name="drawer-demo" />

### Pagination

We've added a pagination component with page navigation, previous and next buttons. Simple, flexible and works with your framework's `<Link />` component.

<ComponentPreview name="pagination-demo" />

### Resizable

Build resizable panel groups and layouts with this `<Resizable />` component.

<ComponentPreview name="resizable-demo-with-handle" />

`<Resizable />` is built using [react-resizable-panels](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels) by [bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn). It has support for mouse, touch and keyboard.

### Sonner

Another one by [emilkowalski\_](https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_). The last toast component you'll ever need. Sonner is now availabe in shadcn/ui.

<ComponentPreview name="sonner-demo" />

### CLI updates

This has been one of the most requested features. You can now configure a custom Tailwind prefix and the cli will automatically prefix your utility classes when adding components.

This means you can now easily add shadcn/ui components to existing projects like Docusaurus, Nextra...etc. A drop-in for your existing design system with no conflict. 🔥

```tsx /tw-/
<AlertDialog className="tw-grid tw-gap-4 tw-border tw-bg-background tw-shadow-lg" />
```

It works with `cn`, `cva` and CSS variables.

The cli can now also detect `tailwind.config.ts` and add the TypeScript version of the config for you.

That's it. Happy Holidays.

## July 2023 - JavaScript

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. **We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well**.

However we provide a JavaScript version of the components, available via the [cli](/docs/cli).

```txt
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no
```

To opt-out of TypeScript, you can use the `tsx` flag in your `components.json` file.

```json {10} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": false,
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "~/lib/utils",
    "components": "~/components"
  }
}
```

To configure import aliases, you can use the following `jsconfig.json`:

```json {4} title="jsconfig.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## June 2023 - New CLI, Styles and more

I have a lot of updates to share with you today:

- [**New CLI**](#new-cli) - Rewrote the CLI from scratch. You can now add components, dependencies and configure import paths.
- [**Theming**](#theming-with-css-variables-or-tailwind-colors) - Choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.
- [**Base color**](#base-color) - Configure the base color for your project. This will be used to generate the default color palette for your components.
- [**React Server Components**](#react-server-components) - Opt out of using React Server Components. The CLI will automatically append or remove the `use client` directive.
- [**Styles**](#styles) - Introducing a new concept called _Style_. A style comes with its own set of components, animations, icons and more.
- [**Exit animations**](#exit-animations) - Added exit animations to all components.
- [**Other updates**](#other-updates) - New `icon` button size, updated `sheet` component and more.
- [**Updating your project**](#updating-your-project) - How to update your project to get the latest changes.

### New CLI

I've been working on a new CLI for the past few weeks. It's a complete rewrite. It comes with a lot of new features and improvements.

### `init`

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

When you run the `init` command, you will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › app/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / yes
```

This file contains all the information about your components: where to install them, the import paths, how they are styled...etc.

You can use this file to change the import path of a component, set a baseColor or change the styling method.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "rsc": false,
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "~/lib/utils",
    "components": "~/components"
  }
}
```

This means you can now use the CLI with any directory structure including `src` and `app` directories.

### `add`

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add
```

The `add` command is now much more capable. You can now add UI components but also import more complex components (coming soon).

The CLI will automatically resolve all components and dependencies, format them based on your custom config and add them to your project.

### `diff` (experimental)

```bash
npx shadcn diff
```

We're also introducing a new `diff` command to help you keep track of upstream updates.

You can use this command to see what has changed in the upstream repository and update your project accordingly.

Run the `diff` command to get a list of components that have updates available:

```bash
npx shadcn diff
```

```txt
The following components have updates available:
- button
  - /path/to/my-app/components/ui/button.tsx
- toast
  - /path/to/my-app/components/ui/use-toast.ts
  - /path/to/my-app/components/ui/toaster.tsx
```

Then run `diff [component]` to see the changes:

```bash
npx shadcn diff alert
```

```diff /pl-12/
const alertVariants = cva(
- "relative w-full rounded-lg border",
+ "relative w-full pl-12 rounded-lg border"
)
```

---

### Theming with CSS Variables or Tailwind Colors

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

When you add new components, the CLI will automatically use the correct theming methods based on your `components.json` configuration.

#### Utility classes

```tsx /bg-zinc-950/ /text-zinc-50/ /dark:bg-white/ /dark:text-zinc-950/
<div className="bg-zinc-950 dark:bg-white" />
```

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false` in your `components.json` file.

```json {6} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": false
  }
}
```

#### CSS Variables

```tsx /bg-background/ /text-foreground/
<div className="bg-background text-foreground" />
```

To use CSS variables classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true` in your `components.json` file.

```json {6} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  }
}
```

---

### Base color

You can now configure the base color for your project. This will be used to generate the default color palette for your components.

```json {5} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": false
  }
}
```

Choose between `gray`, `neutral`, `slate`, `stone` or `zinc`.

If you have `cssVariables` set to `true`, we will set the base colors as CSS variables in your `globals.css` file. If you have `cssVariables` set to `false`, we will inline the Tailwind CSS utility classes in your components.

---

### React Server Components

If you're using a framework that does not support React Server Components, you can now opt out by setting `rsc` to `false`. We will automatically append or remove the `use client` directive when adding components.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "rsc": false
}
```

---

### Styles

We are introducing a new concept called _Style_.

_You can think of style as the visual foundation: shapes, icons, animations & typography._ A style comes with its own set of components, animations, icons and more.

We are shipping two styles: `default` and `new-york` (with more coming soon).

<Image
  src="/images/style.jpg"
  width="716"
  height="402"
  alt="Default vs New York style"
  className="mt-6 overflow-hidden rounded-lg border"
/>

The `default` style is the one you are used to. It's the one we've been using since the beginning of this project. It uses `lucide-react` for icons and `tailwindcss-animate` for animations.

The `new-york` style is a new style. It ships with smaller buttons, cards with shadows and a new set of icons from [Radix Icons](https://icons.radix-ui.com).

When you run the `init` command, you will be asked which style you would like to use. This is saved in your `components.json` file.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "new-york"
}
```

### Theming

Start with a style as the base then theme using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes to completely change the look of your components.

<Image
  src="/images/style-with-theming.jpg"
  width="716"
  height="402"
  alt="Style with theming"
  className="mt-6 overflow-hidden rounded-lg border"
/>

---

### Exit animations

I added exit animations to all components. Click on the combobox below to see the subtle exit animation.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-demo" className="[&_.preview]:items-start" />

The animations can be customized using utility classes.

---

### Other updates

### Button

- Added a new button size `icon`:

<ComponentPreview name="button-icon" />

### Sheet

- Renamed `position` to `side` to match the other elements.

<ComponentPreview name="sheet-side" />

- Removed the `size` props. Use `className="w-[200px] md:w-[450px]"` for responsive sizing.

---

### Updating your project

Since we follow a copy and paste approach, you will need to manually update your project to get the latest changes.

<Callout className="mt-4">
  Note: we are working on a [`diff`](#diff-experimental) command to help you
  keep track of upstream updates.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Add `components.json`

Creating a `components.json` file at the root:

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

Update the values for `tailwind.css` and `aliases` to match your project structure.

### Button

Add the `icon` size to the `buttonVariants`:

```tsx {7} title="components/ui/button.tsx" showLineNumbers
const buttonVariants = cva({
  variants: {
    size: {
      default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
      sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
      lg: "h-11 rounded-md px-8",
      icon: "h-10 w-10",
    },
  },
})
```

### Sheet

1. Replace the content of `sheet.tsx` with the following:

```tsx title="components/ui/sheet.tsx" showLineNumbers
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import * as SheetPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-dialog"
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"
import { X } from "lucide-react"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const Sheet = SheetPrimitive.Root

const SheetTrigger = SheetPrimitive.Trigger

const SheetClose = SheetPrimitive.Close

const SheetPortal = ({
  className,
  ...props
}: SheetPrimitive.DialogPortalProps) => (
  <SheetPrimitive.Portal className={cn(className)} {...props} />
)
SheetPortal.displayName = SheetPrimitive.Portal.displayName

const SheetOverlay = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Overlay>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Overlay>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SheetPrimitive.Overlay
    className={cn(
      "bg-background/80 data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 fixed inset-0 z-50 backdrop-blur-sm",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
    ref={ref}
  />
))
SheetOverlay.displayName = SheetPrimitive.Overlay.displayName

const sheetVariants = cva(
  "fixed z-50 gap-4 bg-background p-6 shadow-lg transition ease-in-out data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:duration-300 data-[state=open]:duration-500",
  {
    variants: {
      side: {
        top: "inset-x-0 top-0 border-b data-[state=closed]:slide-out-to-top data-[state=open]:slide-in-from-top",
        bottom:
          "inset-x-0 bottom-0 border-t data-[state=closed]:slide-out-to-bottom data-[state=open]:slide-in-from-bottom",
        left: "inset-y-0 left-0 h-full w-3/4 border-r data-[state=closed]:slide-out-to-left data-[state=open]:slide-in-from-left sm:max-w-sm",
        right:
          "inset-y-0 right-0 h-full w-3/4  border-l data-[state=closed]:slide-out-to-right data-[state=open]:slide-in-from-right sm:max-w-sm",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      side: "right",
    },
  }
)

interface SheetContentProps
  extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Content>,
    VariantProps<typeof sheetVariants> {}

const SheetContent = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Content>,
  SheetContentProps
>(({ side = "right", className, children, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SheetPortal>
    <SheetOverlay />
    <SheetPrimitive.Content
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(sheetVariants({ side }), className)}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
      <SheetPrimitive.Close className="ring-offset-background focus:ring-ring data-[state=open]:bg-secondary absolute top-4 right-4 rounded-sm opacity-70 transition-opacity hover:opacity-100 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:outline-none disabled:pointer-events-none">
        <X className="h-4 w-4" />
        <span className="sr-only">Close</span>
      </SheetPrimitive.Close>
    </SheetPrimitive.Content>
  </SheetPortal>
))
SheetContent.displayName = SheetPrimitive.Content.displayName

const SheetHeader = ({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>) => (
  <div
    className={cn(
      "flex flex-col space-y-2 text-center sm:text-left",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
)
SheetHeader.displayName = "SheetHeader"

const SheetFooter = ({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>) => (
  <div
    className={cn(
      "flex flex-col-reverse sm:flex-row sm:justify-end sm:space-x-2",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
)
SheetFooter.displayName = "SheetFooter"

const SheetTitle = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Title>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Title>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SheetPrimitive.Title
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-foreground text-lg font-semibold", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
SheetTitle.displayName = SheetPrimitive.Title.displayName

const SheetDescription = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Description>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SheetPrimitive.Description>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SheetPrimitive.Description
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-muted-foreground text-sm", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
SheetDescription.displayName = SheetPrimitive.Description.displayName

export {
  Sheet,
  SheetTrigger,
  SheetClose,
  SheetContent,
  SheetHeader,
  SheetFooter,
  SheetTitle,
  SheetDescription,
}
```

2. Rename `position` to `side`

```diff /position/ /side/
- <Sheet position="right" />
+ <Sheet side="right" />
```

</Steps>

## File: apps/v4/content/docs/(root)/components-json.mdx
````
---
title: components.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

<Callout className="mt-6" title="Note: The `components.json` file is optional">
  It is **only required if you're using the CLI** to add components to your
  project. If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this file.
</Callout>

You can create a `components.json` file in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

See the <Link href="/docs/cli">CLI section</Link> for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for `components.json` [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json).

```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json"
}
```

## style

The style for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "style": "new-york"
}
```

The `default` style has been deprecated. Use the `new-york` style instead.

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the <Link href="/docs/installation">installation section</Link> for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your `tailwind.config.js` file is located. **For Tailwind CSS v4, leave this blank.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "styles/global.css"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.baseColor

This is used to generate the default color palette for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "baseColor": "gray" | "neutral" | "slate" | "stone" | "zinc"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.cssVariables

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false`. For CSS variables, set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": `true` | `false`
  }
}
```

For more information, see the <Link href="/docs/theming">theming docs</Link>.

**This cannot be changed after initialization.** To switch between CSS variables and utility classes, you'll have to delete and re-install your components.

### tailwind.prefix

The prefix to use for your Tailwind CSS utility classes. Components will be added with this prefix.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "prefix": "tw-"
  }
}
```

## rsc

Whether or not to enable support for React Server Components.

The CLI automatically adds a `use client` directive to client components when set to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "rsc": `true` | `false`
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript components.

Setting this option to `false` allows components to be added as JavaScript with the `.jsx` file extension.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tsx": `true` | `false`
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Important:** If you're using the `src` directory, make sure it is included
  under `paths` in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.
</Callout>

### aliases.utils

Import alias for your utility functions.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### aliases.components

Import alias for your components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### aliases.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "ui": "@/app/ui"
  }
}
```

### aliases.lib

Import alias for `lib` functions such as `format-date` or `generate-id`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "lib": "@/lib"
  }
}
```

### aliases.hooks

Import alias for `hooks` such as `use-media-query` or `use-toast`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  }
}
```

title: Introduction
description: shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.
---

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn’t included in the library. **Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

This is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modification.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
- **Distribution:** A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
- **AI-Ready:** Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.

## Open Code

shadcn/ui hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:

- **Full Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.
- **AI Integration:** Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.

_In a typical library, if you need to change a button’s behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With shadcn/ui, you simply edit the button code directly._

    <AccordionTrigger>
      How do I pull upstream updates in an Open Code approach?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <p>
        shadcn/ui follows a headless component architecture. This means the core
        of your app can receive fixes by updating your dependencies, for
        instance, radix-ui or input-otp.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The topmost layer, i.e., the one closest to your design system, is not
        coupled with the implementation of the library. It stays open for
        modification.
      </p>
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Composition

Every component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._

## Distribution

shadcn/ui is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.

- **Schema:** A flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.
- **CLI:** A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.

_You can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema._

## Beautiful Defaults

shadcn/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The design of shadcn/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._

title: JavaScript
description: How to use shadcn/ui with JavaScript
---

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

However we provide a JavaScript version of the components as well. The JavaScript version is available via the [cli](/docs/cli).

To opt-out of TypeScript, you can use the `tsx` flag in your `components.json` file.

```json {10} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": false,
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "~/lib/utils",
    "components": "~/components"
  }
}
```

To configure import aliases, you can use the following `jsconfig.json`:

```json {4} title="jsconfig.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

title: Monorepo
description: Using shadcn/ui components and CLI in a monorepo.
---

Until now, using shadcn/ui in a monorepo was a bit of a pain. You could add
components using the CLI, but you had to manage where the components
were installed and manually fix import paths.

With the new monorepo support in the CLI, we've made it a lot easier to use
shadcn/ui in a monorepo.

The CLI now understands the monorepo structure and will install the components,
dependencies and registry dependencies to the correct paths and handle imports
for you.

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Create a new monorepo project

To create a new monorepo project, run the `init` command. You will be prompted
to select the type of project you are creating.

```bash
npx shadcn@canary init
```

Select the `Next.js (Monorepo)` option.

```bash
? Would you like to start a new project?
    Next.js
❯   Next.js (Monorepo)
```

This will create a new monorepo project with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`,
and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the build system.

Everything is set up for you, so you can start adding components to your project.

Note: The monorepo uses React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Add components to your project

To add components to your project, run the `add` command **in the path of your app**.

```bash
cd apps/web
```

```bash
npx shadcn@canary add [COMPONENT]
```

The CLI will figure out what type of component you are adding and install the
correct files to the correct path.

For example, if you run `npx shadcn@canary add button`, the CLI will install the button component under `packages/ui` and update the import path for components in `apps/web`.

If you run `npx shadcn@canary add login-01`, the CLI will install the `button`, `label`, `input` and `card` components under `packages/ui` and the `login-form` component under `apps/web/components`.

### Importing components

You can import components from the `@workspace/ui` package as follows:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button"
```

You can also import hooks and utilities from the `@workspace/ui` package.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@workspace/ui/hooks/use-theme"
import { cn } from "@workspace/ui/lib/utils"
```

</Steps>

## File Structure

When you create a new monorepo project, the CLI will create the following file structure:

```txt
apps
└── web         # Your app goes here.
    ├── app
    │   └── page.tsx
    ├── components
    │   └── login-form.tsx
    ├── components.json
    └── package.json
packages
└── ui          # Your components and dependencies are installed here.
    ├── src
    │   ├── components
    │   │   └── button.tsx
    │   ├── hooks
    │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── utils.ts
    │   └── styles
    │       └── globals.css
    ├── components.json
    └── package.json
package.json
turbo.json
```

## Requirements

1. Every workspace must have a `components.json` file. A `package.json` file tells npm how to install the dependencies. A `components.json` file tells the CLI how and where to install components.

2. The `components.json` file must properly define aliases for the workspace. This tells the CLI how to import components, hooks, utilities, etc.

```json showLineNumbers title="apps/web/components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "hooks": "@/hooks",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "utils": "@workspace/ui/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@workspace/ui/components"
  }
}
```

```json showLineNumbers title="packages/ui/components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "zinc",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@workspace/ui/components",
    "utils": "@workspace/ui/lib/utils",
    "hooks": "@workspace/ui/hooks",
    "lib": "@workspace/ui/lib",
    "ui": "@workspace/ui/components"
  }
}
```

3. Ensure you have the same `style`, `iconLibrary` and `baseColor` in both `components.json` files.

4. **For Tailwind CSS v4, leave the `tailwind` config empty in the `components.json` file.**

By following these requirements, the CLI will be able to install ui components, blocks, libs and hooks to the correct paths and handle imports for you.

title: Next.js 15 + React 19
description: Using shadcn/ui with Next.js 15 and React 19.
---

<Callout className="mb-6 border-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:border-blue-900 dark:bg-blue-950 [&_code]:bg-blue-100 dark:[&_code]:bg-blue-900">
  **Update:** We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v4 in the
  `canary` release. See the docs for [Tailwind v4](/docs/tailwind-v4) for more
  information.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  **The following guide applies to any framework that supports React 19**. I
  titled this page "Next.js 15 + React 19" to help people upgrading to Next.js
  15 find it. We are working with package maintainers to help upgrade to React
  19.
</Callout>

## TL;DR

If you're using `npm`, you can install shadcn/ui dependencies with a flag. The `shadcn` CLI will prompt you to select a flag when you run it. No flags required for pnpm, bun, or yarn.

See [Upgrade Status](#upgrade-status) for the status of React 19 support for each package.

## What's happening?

React 19 is now [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react?activeTab=versions) and is [tested and supported in the latest Next.js 15 release](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15#react-19).

To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is [already](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/2952) [in](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk/pull/318) [progress](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul/pull/498).

```diff /^19.0/
"peerDependencies": {
-  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0",
+  "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0",
-  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0"
+  "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0 || ^19.0"
},
```

<Callout>
  You can check if a package lists React 19 as a peer dependency by running
  `npm info <package> peerDependencies`.
</Callout>

In the meantime, if you are installing a package that **does not** list React 19 as a peer dependency, you will see an error message like this:

```bash
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: my-app@0.1.0
npm error Found: react@19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021" from the root project
```

<Callout>
  **Note:** This is npm only. PNPM and Bun will only show a silent warning.
</Callout>

## How to fix this

### Solution 1: `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`

You can force install a package with the `--force` or the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

```bash
npm i <package> --force

npm i <package> --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will install the package and ignore the peer dependency warnings.

<Accordion type="multiple">
  <AccordionItem value="flags">
    <AccordionTrigger className="font-medium">
      What do the `--force` and `--legacy-peer-deps` flag do?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="[&_ul]:mt-0">

      - `--force`: Ignores and overrides any dependency conflicts, forcing the
        installation of packages.
      - `--legacy-peer-deps`: Skips strict peer dependency checks, allowing
        installation of packages with unmet peer dependencies to avoid errors.

    </AccordionContent>

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Solution 2: Use React 18

You can downgrade `react` and `react-dom` to version 18, which is compatible with the package you are installing and upgrade when the dependency is updated.

```bash
npm i react@18 react-dom@18
```

Whichever solution you choose, make sure you test your app thoroughly to ensure
there are no regressions.

## Using shadcn/ui on Next.js 15

### Using pnpm, bun, or yarn

Follow the instructions in the [installation guide](/docs/installation/next) to install shadcn/ui. No flags are needed.

### Using npm

When you run `npx shadcn@latest init -d`, you will be prompted to select an option to resolve the peer dependency issues.

```bash
It looks like you are using React 19.
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues (see https://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).

? How would you like to proceed? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Use --force
    Use --legacy-peer-deps
```

You can then run the command with the flag you choose.

## Adding components

The process for adding components is the same as above. Select a flag to resolve the peer dependency issues.

**Remember to always test your app after installing new dependencies.**

## Upgrade Status

To make it easy for you track the progress of the upgrade, I've created a table below with React 19 support status for the shadcn/ui dependencies.

- ✅ - Works with React 19 using npm, pnpm, and bun.
- 🚧 - Works with React 19 using pnpm and bun. Requires flag for npm. PR is in progress.

## Recharts

To use recharts with React 19, you will need to override the `react-is` dependency.

<Steps>

<Step>Add the following to your `package.json`</Step>

```json title="package.json"
"overrides": {
  "react-is": "^19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021"
}
```

Note: the `react-is` version needs to match the version of React 19 you are using. The above is an example.

<Step>Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`</Step>

The OpenAI API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI models for text generation, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This example generates text output from a prompt, as you might using ChatGPT.

## Analyze image inputs

You can provide image inputs to the model as well. Scan receipts, analyze screenshots, or find objects in the real world with [computer vision](/docs/installation/computer-vision). This is code in a `pre` tag and `npx` command in a `code` tag.

```bash
npm install foo
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

```tsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
// With line numbers
export default function Home() {
  return <div>Hello</div>
}
```

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
export default function Button({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <button>{children}</button>
}
```

This is a code block with a title.

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

Draw attention to a particular line of code.

```tsx {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react"

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating()

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Word Highlighting

Draw attention to a particular word or series of characters.

```tsx /floatingStyles/
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react"

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating()

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  )
}
```

## CSS Variables

```tsx /bg-background/ /text-foreground/
<div className="bg-background text-foreground" />
```

To use CSS variables for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true` in your `components.json` file.

```json {8} title="components.json"
{
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/registry/new-york-v4/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"
}
```

## Utility classes

```tsx /bg-zinc-950/ /text-zinc-50/ /dark:bg-white/ /dark:text-zinc-950/
<div className="bg-zinc-950 dark:bg-white" />
```

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false` in your `components.json` file.

```json {8} title="components.json"
{
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": false
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/registry/new-york-v4/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"

title: Tailwind v4
description: How to use shadcn/ui with Tailwind v4 and React 19.
---

It’s here! Tailwind v4 and React 19. Ready for you to try out. You can start using it today.

## What's New

- The CLI can now initialize projects with Tailwind v4.
- Full support for the new `@theme` directive and `@theme inline` option.
- All components are updated for Tailwind v4 and React 19.
- We’ve removed the forwardRefs and adjusted the types.
- Every primitive now has a `data-slot` attribute for styling.
- We've fixed and cleaned up the style of the components.
- We're deprecating the `toast` component in favor of `sonner`.
- Buttons now use the default cursor.
- We're deprecating the `default` style. New projects will use `new-york`.
- HSL colors are now converted to OKLCH.

**Note: this is non-breaking. Your existing apps with Tailwind v3 and React 18 will still work. When you add new components, they'll still be in v3 and React 18 until you upgrade. Only new projects start with Tailwind v4 and React 19.**

## Try It Out

You can test Tailwind v4 + React 19 today using the `canary` release of the CLI. See the framework specific guides below for how to get started.

## Upgrade Your Project

<Callout className="mt-6 mb-6 border-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:border-blue-900 dark:bg-blue-950 [&_code]:bg-blue-100 dark:[&_code]:bg-blue-900">
  **Important:** Before upgrading, please read the [Tailwind v4 Compatibility
  Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/compatibility) and make sure your project
  is ready for the upgrade. Tailwind v4 uses bleeding-edge browser features and
  is designed for modern browsers.
</Callout>

One of the major advantages of using `shadcn/ui` is that the code you end up with is exactly what you'd write yourself. There are no hidden abstractions.

This means when a dependency has a new release, you can just follow the official upgrade paths.

Here's how to upgrade your existing projects (full docs are on the way):

### 1. Follow the Tailwind v4 Upgrade Guide

- Upgrade to Tailwind v4 by following the official upgrade guide: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide
- Use the `@tailwindcss/upgrade@next` codemod to remove deprecated utility classes and update tailwind config.

### 2. Update your CSS variables

The codemod will migrate your CSS variables as references under the `@theme` directive.

```css showLineNumbers
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;
  }
}

@theme {
  --color-background: hsl(var(--background));
  --color-foreground: hsl(var(--foreground));
}
```

This works. But to make it easier to work with colors and other variables, we'll need to move the `hsl` wrappers and use `@theme inline`.

Here's how you do it:

1. Move `:root` and `.dark` out of the `@layer` base.
2. Wrap the color values in `hsl()`
3. Add the `inline` option to `@theme` i.e `@theme inline`
4. Remove the `hsl()` wrappers from `@theme`

```css showLineNumbers
:root {
  --background: hsl(0 0% 100%); // <-- Wrap in hsl
  --foreground: hsl(0 0% 3.9%);
}

.dark {
  --background: hsl(0 0% 3.9%); // <-- Wrap in hsl
  --foreground: hsl(0 0% 98%);
}

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background); // <-- Remove hsl
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}
```

This change makes it much simpler to access your theme variables in both utility classes and outside of CSS for eg. using color values in JavaScript.

### 3. Update colors for charts

Now that the theme colors come with `hsl()`, you can remove the wrapper in your `chartConfig`:

```diff
const chartConfig = {
  desktop: {
    label: "Desktop",
-    color: "hsl(var(--chart-1))",
+    color: "var(--chart-1)",
  },
  mobile: {
    label: "Mobile",
-   color: "hsl(var(--chart-2))",
+   color: "var(--chart-2)",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

### 4. Use new `size-*` utility

The new `size-*` utility (added in Tailwind v3.4), is now fully supported by `tailwind-merge`. You can replace `w-* h-*` with the new `size-*` utility:

```diff
- w-4 h-4
+ size-4
```

### 5. Update your dependencies

```bash
pnpm up "@radix-ui/*" cmdk lucide-react recharts tailwind-merge clsx --latest
```

### 6. Remove forwardRef

You can use the `remove-forward-ref` codemod to migrate your `forwardRef` to props or manually update the primitives.

For the codemod, see https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod#remove-forward-ref.

If you want to do it manually, here's how to do it step by step:

1. Replace `React.forwardRef<...>` with `React.ComponentProps<...>`
2. Remove `ref={ref}` from the component.
3. Add a `data-slot` attribute. This will come in handy for styling with Tailwind.
4. You can optionally convert to a named function and remove the `displayName`.

#### Before

```tsx showLineNumbers
const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Item
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("border-b last:border-b-0", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem"
```

#### After

```tsx showLineNumbers
function AccordionItem({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>) {
  return (
    <AccordionPrimitive.Item
      data-slot="accordion-item"
      className={cn("border-b last:border-b-0", className)}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

## Changelog

### March 19, 2025 - Deprecate `tailwindcss-animate`

We've deprecated `tailwindcss-animate` in favor of `tw-animate-css`.

New project will have `tw-animate-css` installed by default.

For existing projects, follow the steps below to migrate.

1. Remove `tailwindcss-animate` from your dependencies.
2. Remove the `@plugin 'tailwindcss-animate'` from your globals.css file.
3. Install `tw-animate-css` as a dev dependency.
4. Add the `@import "tw-animate-css"` to your globals.css file.

```diff showLineNumbers
- @plugin 'tailwindcss-animate';
+ @import "tw-animate-css";
```

### March 12, 2025 - New Dark Mode Colors

We've revisted the dark mode colors and updated them to be more accessible.

If you're running an existing Tailwind v4 project (**not an upgraded one**[^1]), you can update your components to use the new dark mode colors by re-adding your components using the CLI[^2].

<Steps>

<Step>Commit any changes</Step>

**The CLI will overwrite your existing components.** We recommend committing any changes you've made to your components before running the CLI.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "..."
```

<Step>Update components</Step>

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add --all --overwrite
```

<Step>Update colors</Step>

Update the dark mode colors in your `globals.css` file to new OKLCH colors. See the [Base Colors](/docs/theming#base-colors) reference for a list of colors.

<Step>Review changes</Step>

Review and re-apply any changes you made to your components.

</Steps>

[^1]: Upgraded projects are not affected by this change. You can continue using the old dark mode colors.

[^2]: Updating your components will overwrite your existing components.

title: Theming
description: Using CSS Variables and color utilities for theming.
---

You can choose between using CSS variables (recommended) or utility classes for theming.

## CSS Variables

```tsx /bg-background/ /text-foreground/
<div className="bg-background text-foreground" />
```

To use CSS variables for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true` in your `components.json` file.

```json {8} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"
}
```

## Utility classes

```tsx /bg-zinc-950/ /text-zinc-50/ /dark:bg-white/ /dark:text-zinc-950/
<div className="bg-zinc-950 dark:bg-white" />
```

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false` in your `components.json` file.

```json {8} title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": false
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"
}
```

## Convention

We use a simple `background` and `foreground` convention for colors. The `background` variable is used for the background color of the component and the `foreground` variable is used for the text color.

<Callout className="mt-4">

The `background` suffix is omitted when the variable is used for the background color of the component.

</Callout>

Given the following CSS variables:

```css
--primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);
--primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
```

The `background` color of the following component will be `var(--primary)` and the `foreground` color will be `var(--primary-foreground)`.

```tsx
<div className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">Hello</div>
```

## List of variables

Here's the list of variables available for customization:

  --sidebar-border: oklch(1 0 0 / 10%);
  --sidebar-ring: oklch(0.439 0 0);
}
```

## Adding new colors

To add new colors, you need to add them to your CSS file and to your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```css title="app/globals.css" showLineNumbers
:root {
  --warning: oklch(0.84 0.16 84);
  --warning-foreground: oklch(0.28 0.07 46);
}

.dark {
  --warning: oklch(0.41 0.11 46);
  --warning-foreground: oklch(0.99 0.02 95);
}

@theme inline {
  --color-warning: var(--warning);
  --color-warning-foreground: var(--warning-foreground);
}
```

You can now use the `warning` utility class in your components.

```tsx /bg-warning/ /text-warning-foreground/
<div className="bg-warning text-warning-foreground" />
```

## Other color formats

See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) for more information on using colors in Tailwind CSS.

<Step>Update the import paths to match your project setup.</Step>

</Steps>

</TabsContent>

</CodeTabs>

## Usage

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {
  Breadcrumb,
  BreadcrumbItem,
  BreadcrumbLink,
  BreadcrumbList,
  BreadcrumbPage,
  BreadcrumbSeparator,
} from "@/components/ui/breadcrumb"
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbList>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbSeparator />
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/components">Components</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbSeparator />
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbPage>Breadcrumb</BreadcrumbPage>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
  </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

## Examples

### Custom separator

Use a custom component as `children` for `<BreadcrumbSeparator />` to create a custom separator.

<ComponentPreview
  name="breadcrumb-separator"
  description="A breadcrumb with a custom separator"
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,10-12}
import { SlashIcon } from "lucide-react"

...

<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbList>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbSeparator>
      <SlashIcon />
    </BreadcrumbSeparator>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink href="/components">Components</BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
  </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

---

### Dropdown

You can compose `<BreadcrumbItem />` with a `<DropdownMenu />` to create a dropdown in the breadcrumb.

<ComponentPreview
  name="breadcrumb-dropdown"
  className="[&_.preview]:p-2"
  description="A breadcrumb with a dropdown."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {1-6,11-21}
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu"

...

<BreadcrumbItem>
  <DropdownMenu>
    <DropdownMenuTrigger>
      Components
    </DropdownMenuTrigger>
    <DropdownMenuContent align="start">
      <DropdownMenuItem>Documentation</DropdownMenuItem>
      <DropdownMenuItem>Themes</DropdownMenuItem>
      <DropdownMenuItem>GitHub</DropdownMenuItem>
    </DropdownMenuContent>
  </DropdownMenu>
</BreadcrumbItem>
```

---

### Collapsed

We provide a `<BreadcrumbEllipsis />` component to show a collapsed state when the breadcrumb is too long.

<ComponentPreview
  name="breadcrumb-ellipsis"
  className="[&_.preview]:p-2"
  description="A breadcrumb showing a collapsed state."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,9}
import { BreadcrumbEllipsis } from "@/components/ui/breadcrumb"

...

<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbList>
    {/* ... */}
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbEllipsis />
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    {/* ... */}
  </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

---

### Link component

To use a custom link component from your routing library, you can use the `asChild` prop on `<BreadcrumbLink />`.

<ComponentPreview
  name="breadcrumb-link"
  description="A breadcrumb with a custom Link component"
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,8-10}
import { Link } from "next/link"

...

<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbList>
    <BreadcrumbItem>
      <BreadcrumbLink asChild>
        <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      </BreadcrumbLink>
    </BreadcrumbItem>
    {/* ... */}
  </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

---

### Responsive

Here's an example of a responsive breadcrumb that composes `<BreadcrumbItem />` with `<BreadcrumbEllipsis />`, `<DropdownMenu />`, and `<Drawer />`.

It displays a dropdown on desktop and a drawer on mobile.

<ComponentPreview
  name="breadcrumb-responsive"
  className="[&_.preview]:p-2"
  description="A responsive breadcrumb. It displays a dropdown on desktop and a drawer on mobile."
/>

<Step>Update the import paths to match your project setup.</Step>

</Steps>

</TabsContent>

</CodeTabs>

## Usage

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselContent,
  CarouselItem,
  CarouselNext,
  CarouselPrevious,
} from "@/components/ui/carousel"
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Carousel>
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
  <CarouselPrevious />
  <CarouselNext />
</Carousel>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

To set the size of the items, you can use the `basis` utility class on the `<CarouselItem />`.

<ComponentPreview
  name="carousel-size"
  title="Carousel"
  description="A carousel with 3 active items of equal size."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {4-6}
// 33% of the carousel width.
<Carousel>
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem className="basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

```tsx showLineNumbers {4-6}
// 50% on small screens and 33% on larger screens.
<Carousel>
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem className="md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3">...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

### Spacing

To set the spacing between the items, we use a `pl-[VALUE]` utility on the `<CarouselItem />` and a negative `-ml-[VALUE]` on the `<CarouselContent />`.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Why:** I tried to use the `gap` property or a `grid` layout on the `
  <CarouselContent />` but it required a lot of math and mental effort to get the
  spacing right. I found `pl-[VALUE]` and `-ml-[VALUE]` utilities much easier to
  use.

You can always adjust this in your own project if you need to.

</Callout>

<ComponentPreview
  name="carousel-spacing"
  title="Carousel"
  description="A carousel with 3 items with a spacing of 1rem."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers /-ml-4/ /pl-4/
<Carousel>
  <CarouselContent className="-ml-4">
    <CarouselItem className="pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

```tsx showLineNumbers /-ml-2/ /pl-2/ /md:-ml-4/ /md:pl-4/
<Carousel>
  <CarouselContent className="-ml-2 md:-ml-4">
    <CarouselItem className="pl-2 md:pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="pl-2 md:pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem className="pl-2 md:pl-4">...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

### Orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to set the orientation of the carousel.

<ComponentPreview
  name="carousel-orientation"
  title="Carousel"
  description="A vertical carousel."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers /vertical | horizontal/
<Carousel orientation="vertical | horizontal">
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

## Options

You can pass options to the carousel using the `opts` prop. See the [Embla Carousel docs](https://www.embla-carousel.com/api/options/) for more information.

```tsx showLineNumbers {2-5}
<Carousel
  opts={{
    align: "start",
    loop: true,
  }}
>
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
</Carousel>
```

## API

Use a state and the `setApi` props to get an instance of the carousel API.

<ComponentPreview
  name="carousel-api"
  title="Carousel"
  description="A carousel with a slide counter."
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,4,22}
import { type CarouselApi } from "@/components/ui/carousel"

export function Example() {
  const [api, setApi] = React.useState<CarouselApi>()
  const [current, setCurrent] = React.useState(0)
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!api) {
      return
    }

    setCount(api.scrollSnapList().length)
    setCurrent(api.selectedScrollSnap() + 1)

    api.on("select", () => {
      setCurrent(api.selectedScrollSnap() + 1)
    })
  }, [api])

  return (
    <Carousel setApi={setApi}>
      <CarouselContent>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
      </CarouselContent>
    </Carousel>
  )
}
```

## Events

You can listen to events using the api instance from `setApi`.

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,4-14,16}
import { type CarouselApi } from "@/components/ui/carousel"

export function Example() {
  const [api, setApi] = React.useState<CarouselApi>()

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!api) {
      return
    }

    api.on("select", () => {
      // Do something on select.
    })
  }, [api])

  return (
    <Carousel setApi={setApi}>
      <CarouselContent>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
        <CarouselItem>...</CarouselItem>
      </CarouselContent>
    </Carousel>
  )
}
```

See the [Embla Carousel docs](https://www.embla-carousel.com/api/events/) for more information on using events.

## Plugins

You can use the `plugins` prop to add plugins to the carousel.

```ts showLineNumbers {1,6-10}
import Autoplay from "embla-carousel-autoplay"

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Carousel
      plugins={[
        Autoplay({
          delay: 2000,
        }),
      ]}
    >
      // ...
    </Carousel>
  )
}
```

<ComponentPreview
  name="carousel-plugin"
  title="Carousel"
  description="A carousel with the autoplay plugin."
/>

See the [Embla Carousel docs](https://www.embla-carousel.com/api/plugins/) for more information on using plugins.

title: Chart
description: Beautiful charts. Built using Recharts. Copy and paste into your apps.
component: true

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-interactive"
  className="theme-blue -mt-4 [&_.preview]:p-0 [&_.preview]:lg:min-h-[404px] [&_.preview>div]:w-full [&_.preview>div]:border-none [&_.preview>div]:shadow-none"

Introducing **Charts**. A collection of chart components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

Charts are designed to look great out of the box. They work well with the other components and are fully customizable to fit your project.

[Browse the Charts Library](/charts).

## Component

We use [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) under the hood.

We designed the `chart` component with composition in mind. **You build your charts using Recharts components and only bring in custom components, such as `ChartTooltip`, when and where you need it**.

```tsx showLineNumbers /ChartContainer/ /ChartTooltipContent/
import { Bar, BarChart } from "recharts"

import { ChartContainer, ChartTooltipContent } from "@/components/ui/charts"

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <ChartContainer>
      <BarChart data={data}>
        <Bar dataKey="value" />
        <ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
      </BarChart>
    </ChartContainer>
  )
}
```

We do not wrap Recharts. This means you're not locked into an abstraction. When a new Recharts version is released, you can follow the official upgrade path to upgrade your charts.

**The components are yours**.

## Installation

**Note:** If you are using charts with **React 19** or the **Next.js 15**, see the note [here](/docs/react-19#recharts).

## Your First Chart

Let's build your first chart. We'll build a bar chart, add a grid, axis, tooltip and legend.

<Steps>

<Step>Start by defining your data</Step>

The following data represents the number of desktop and mobile users for each month.

<Callout className="mt-4">

**Note:** Your data can be in any shape. You are not limited to the shape of the data below. Use the `dataKey` prop to map your data to the chart.

</Callout>

```tsx title="components/example-chart.tsx" showLineNumbers
const chartData = [
  { month: "January", desktop: 186, mobile: 80 },
  { month: "February", desktop: 305, mobile: 200 },
  { month: "March", desktop: 237, mobile: 120 },
  { month: "April", desktop: 73, mobile: 190 },
  { month: "May", desktop: 209, mobile: 130 },
  { month: "June", desktop: 214, mobile: 140 },
]
```

<Step>Define your chart config</Step>

The chart config holds configuration for the chart. This is where you place human-readable strings, such as labels, icons and color tokens for theming.

```tsx title="components/example-chart.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { type ChartConfig } from "@/components/ui/chart"

const chartConfig = {
  desktop: {
    label: "Desktop",
    color: "#2563eb",
  },
  mobile: {
    label: "Mobile",
    color: "#60a5fa",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

<Step>Build your chart</Step>

You can now build your chart using Recharts components.

<Callout className="mt-4 bg-amber-50 border-amber-200 dark:bg-amber-950/50 dark:border-amber-950">

**Important:** Remember to set a `min-h-[VALUE]` on the `ChartContainer` component. This is required for the chart be responsive.

</Callout>

<ComponentSource name="chart-bar-demo" title="components/example-chart.tsx" />

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-demo"
  className="[&_.preview]:min-h-[250px] [&_.preview]:p-4"
/>

</Steps>

### Add a Grid

Let's add a grid to the chart.

<Steps>

<Step>Import the `CartesianGrid` component.</Step>

```tsx /CartesianGrid/
import { Bar, BarChart, CartesianGrid } from "recharts"
```

<Step>Add the `CartesianGrid` component to your chart.</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers {3}
<ChartContainer config={chartConfig} className="min-h-[200px] w-full">
  <BarChart accessibilityLayer data={chartData}>
    <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
    <Bar dataKey="desktop" fill="var(--color-desktop)" radius={4} />
    <Bar dataKey="mobile" fill="var(--color-mobile)" radius={4} />
  </BarChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-demo-grid"
  className="[&_.preview]:min-h-[250px] [&_.preview]:p-4"
/>

</Steps>

### Add an Axis

To add an x-axis to the chart, we'll use the `XAxis` component.

<Steps>

<Step>Import the `XAxis` component.</Step>

```tsx /XAxis/
import { Bar, BarChart, CartesianGrid, XAxis } from "recharts"
```

<Step>Add the `XAxis` component to your chart.</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers {4-10}
<ChartContainer config={chartConfig} className="h-[200px] w-full">
  <BarChart accessibilityLayer data={chartData}>
    <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
    <XAxis
      dataKey="month"
      tickLine={false}
      tickMargin={10}
      axisLine={false}
      tickFormatter={(value) => value.slice(0, 3)}
    />
    <Bar dataKey="desktop" fill="var(--color-desktop)" radius={4} />
    <Bar dataKey="mobile" fill="var(--color-mobile)" radius={4} />
  </BarChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-demo-axis"
  className="[&_.preview]:min-h-[250px] [&_.preview]:p-4"
/>

</Steps>

### Add Tooltip

So far we've only used components from Recharts. They look great out of the box thanks to some customization in the `chart` component.

To add a tooltip, we'll use the custom `ChartTooltip` and `ChartTooltipContent` components from `chart`.

<Steps>

<Step>Import the `ChartTooltip` and `ChartTooltipContent` components.</Step>

```tsx
import { ChartTooltip, ChartTooltipContent } from "@/components/ui/chart"
```

<Step>Add the components to your chart.</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers {11}
<ChartContainer config={chartConfig} className="h-[200px] w-full">
  <BarChart accessibilityLayer data={chartData}>
    <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
    <XAxis
      dataKey="month"
      tickLine={false}
      tickMargin={10}
      axisLine={false}
      tickFormatter={(value) => value.slice(0, 3)}
    />
    <ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
    <Bar dataKey="desktop" fill="var(--color-desktop)" radius={4} />
    <Bar dataKey="mobile" fill="var(--color-mobile)" radius={4} />
  </BarChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-demo-tooltip"
  className="[&_.preview]:min-h-[250px] [&_.preview]:p-4"
/>

Hover to see the tooltips. Easy, right? Two components, and we've got a beautiful tooltip.

</Steps>

### Add Legend

We'll do the same for the legend. We'll use the `ChartLegend` and `ChartLegendContent` components from `chart`.

<Steps>

<Step>Import the `ChartLegend` and `ChartLegendContent` components.</Step>

```tsx
import { ChartLegend, ChartLegendContent } from "@/components/ui/chart"
```

<Step>Add the components to your chart.</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers {12}
<ChartContainer config={chartConfig} className="h-[200px] w-full">
  <BarChart accessibilityLayer data={chartData}>
    <CartesianGrid vertical={false} />
    <XAxis
      dataKey="month"
      tickLine={false}
      tickMargin={10}
      axisLine={false}
      tickFormatter={(value) => value.slice(0, 3)}
    />
    <ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
    <ChartLegend content={<ChartLegendContent />} />
    <Bar dataKey="desktop" fill="var(--color-desktop)" radius={4} />
    <Bar dataKey="mobile" fill="var(--color-mobile)" radius={4} />
  </BarChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-bar-demo-legend"
  className="[&_.preview]:min-h-[250px] [&_.preview]:p-4"
/>

</Steps>

Done. You've built your first chart! What's next?

- [Tooltip](/docs/components/chart#tooltip)
- [Legend](/docs/components/chart#legend)

## Chart Config

The chart config is where you define the labels, icons and colors for a chart.

It is intentionally decoupled from chart data.

This allows you to share config and color tokens between charts. It can also works independently for cases where your data or color tokens live remotely or in a different format.

```tsx showLineNumbers /ChartConfig/
import { Monitor } from "lucide-react"

import { type ChartConfig } from "@/components/ui/chart"

const chartConfig = {
  desktop: {
    label: "Desktop",
    icon: Monitor,
    // A color like 'hsl(220, 98%, 61%)' or 'var(--color-name)'
    color: "#2563eb",
    // OR a theme object with 'light' and 'dark' keys
    theme: {
      light: "#2563eb",
      dark: "#dc2626",
    },
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

## Theming

Charts has built-in support for theming. You can use css variables (recommended) or color values in any color format, such as hex, hsl or oklch.

### CSS Variables

<Steps>

<Step>Define your colors in your css file</Step>

```css {6-7,14-15} title="app/globals.css" showLineNumbers
@layer base {
  :root {
    --chart-1: oklch(0.646 0.222 41.116);
    --chart-2: oklch(0.6 0.118 184.704);
  }

  .dark: {
    --chart-1: oklch(0.488 0.243 264.376);
    --chart-2: oklch(0.696 0.17 162.48);
  }
}
```

<Step>Add the color to your `chartConfig`</Step>

```tsx {4,8} showLineNumbers
const chartConfig = {
  desktop: {
    label: "Desktop",
    color: "var(--chart-1)",
  },
  mobile: {
    label: "Mobile",
    color: "var(--chart-2)",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

</Steps>

### hex, hsl or oklch

You can also define your colors directly in the chart config. Use the color format you prefer.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const chartConfig = {
  desktop: {
    label: "Desktop",
    color: "#2563eb",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

### Using Colors

To use the theme colors in your chart, reference the colors using the format `var(--color-KEY)`.

#### Components

```tsx
<Bar dataKey="desktop" fill="var(--color-desktop)" />
```

#### Chart Data

```tsx showLineNumbers
const chartData = [
  { browser: "chrome", visitors: 275, fill: "var(--color-chrome)" },
  { browser: "safari", visitors: 200, fill: "var(--color-safari)" },
]
```

#### Tailwind

```tsx
<LabelList className="fill-[--color-desktop]" />
```

## Tooltip

A chart tooltip contains a label, name, indicator and value. You can use a combination of these to customize your tooltip.

<ComponentPreview
  name="chart-tooltip-demo"
  className="[&_.preview]:py-0"
  hideCode
/>

You can turn on/off any of these using the `hideLabel`, `hideIndicator` props and customize the indicator style using the `indicator` prop.

Use `labelKey` and `nameKey` to use a custom key for the tooltip label and name.

Chart comes with the `<ChartTooltip>` and `<ChartTooltipContent>` components. You can use these two components to add custom tooltips to your chart.

```tsx
import { ChartTooltip, ChartTooltipContent } from "@/components/ui/chart"
```

```tsx
<ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
```

### Props

Use the following props to customize the tooltip.

| Prop            | Type                     | Description                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `labelKey`      | string                   | The config or data key to use for the label. |
| `nameKey`       | string                   | The config or data key to use for the name.  |
| `indicator`     | `dot` `line` or `dashed` | The indicator style for the tooltip.         |
| `hideLabel`     | boolean                  | Whether to hide the label.                   |
| `hideIndicator` | boolean                  | Whether to hide the indicator.               |

### Colors

Colors are automatically referenced from the chart config.

### Custom

To use a custom key for tooltip label and names, use the `labelKey` and `nameKey` props.

```tsx showLineNumbers /browser/
const chartData = [
  { browser: "chrome", visitors: 187, fill: "var(--color-chrome)" },
  { browser: "safari", visitors: 200, fill: "var(--color-safari)" },
]

const chartConfig = {
  visitors: {
    label: "Total Visitors",
  },
  chrome: {
    label: "Chrome",
    color: "hsl(var(--chart-1))",
  },
  safari: {
    label: "Safari",
    color: "hsl(var(--chart-2))",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

```tsx
<ChartTooltip
  content={<ChartTooltipContent labelKey="visitors" nameKey="browser" />}
/>
```

This will use `Total Visitors` for label and `Chrome` and `Safari` for the tooltip names.

## Legend

You can use the custom `<ChartLegend>` and `<ChartLegendContent>` components to add a legend to your chart.

```tsx
import { ChartLegend, ChartLegendContent } from "@/components/ui/chart"
```

```tsx
<ChartLegend content={<ChartLegendContent />} />
```

### Colors

Colors are automatically referenced from the chart config.

### Custom

To use a custom key for legend names, use the `nameKey` prop.

```tsx showLineNumbers /browser/
const chartData = [
  { browser: "chrome", visitors: 187, fill: "var(--color-chrome)" },
  { browser: "safari", visitors: 200, fill: "var(--color-safari)" },
]

const chartConfig = {
  chrome: {
    label: "Chrome",
    color: "hsl(var(--chart-1))",
  },
  safari: {
    label: "Safari",
    color: "hsl(var(--chart-2))",
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig
```

```tsx
<ChartLegend content={<ChartLegendContent nameKey="browser" />} />
```

This will use `Chrome` and `Safari` for the legend names.

## Accessibility

You can turn on the `accessibilityLayer` prop to add an accessible layer to your chart.

This prop adds keyboard access and screen reader support to your charts.

```tsx
<LineChart accessibilityLayer />
```

<ComponentPreview name="data-table-demo" className="[&_.preview]:items-start" />

## Introduction

Every data table or datagrid I've created has been unique. They all behave differently, have specific sorting and filtering requirements, and work with different data sources.

It doesn't make sense to combine all of these variations into a single component. If we do that, we'll lose the flexibility that [headless UI](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/introduction#what-is-headless-ui) provides.

So instead of a data-table component, I thought it would be more helpful to provide a guide on how to build your own.

We'll start with the basic `<Table />` component and build a complex data table from scratch.

<Callout className="mt-4">

**Tip:** If you find yourself using the same table in multiple places in your app, you can always extract it into a reusable component.

</Callout>

## Table of Contents

This guide will show you how to use [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table) and the `<Table />` component to build your own custom data table. We'll cover the following topics:

- [Basic Table](#basic-table)
- [Row Actions](#row-actions)
- [Pagination](#pagination)
- [Sorting](#sorting)
- [Filtering](#filtering)
- [Visibility](#visibility)
- [Row Selection](#row-selection)
- [Reusable Components](#reusable-components)

## Installation

1. Add the `<Table />` component to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add table
```

2. Add `tanstack/react-table` dependency:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-table
```

## Prerequisites

We are going to build a table to show recent payments. Here's what our data looks like:

```tsx showLineNumbers
type Payment = {
  id: string
  amount: number
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "success" | "failed"
  email: string
}

export const payments: Payment[] = [
  {
    id: "728ed52f",
    amount: 100,
    status: "pending",
    email: "m@example.com",
  },
  {
    id: "489e1d42",
    amount: 125,
    status: "processing",
    email: "example@gmail.com",
  },
  // ...
]
```

## Project Structure

Start by creating the following file structure:

```txt
app
└── payments
    ├── columns.tsx
    ├── data-table.tsx
    └── page.tsx
```

I'm using a Next.js example here but this works for any other React framework.

- `columns.tsx` (client component) will contain our column definitions.
- `data-table.tsx` (client component) will contain our `<DataTable />` component.
- `page.tsx` (server component) is where we'll fetch data and render our table.

## Basic Table

Let's start by building a basic table.

<Steps>

### Column Definitions

First, we'll define our columns.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/columns.tsx" {3,14-27}
"use client"

import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"

// This type is used to define the shape of our data.
// You can use a Zod schema here if you want.
export type Payment = {
  id: string
  amount: number
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "success" | "failed"
  email: string
}

export const columns: ColumnDef<Payment>[] = [
  {
    accessorKey: "status",
    header: "Status",
  },
  {
    accessorKey: "email",
    header: "Email",
  },
  {
    accessorKey: "amount",
    header: "Amount",
  },
]
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

**Note:** Columns are where you define the core of what your table
will look like. They define the data that will be displayed, how it will be
formatted, sorted and filtered.

</Callout>

### `<DataTable />` component

Next, we'll create a `<DataTable />` component to render our table.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx"
"use client"

import {
  ColumnDef,
  flexRender,
  getCoreRowModel,
  useReactTable,
} from "@tanstack/react-table"

import {
  Table,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
  TableHead,
  TableHeader,
  TableRow,
} from "@/components/ui/table"

interface DataTableProps<TData, TValue> {
  columns: ColumnDef<TData, TValue>[]
  data: TData[]
}

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  })

  return (
    <div className="rounded-md border">
      <Table>
        <TableHeader>
          {table.getHeaderGroups().map((headerGroup) => (
            <TableRow key={headerGroup.id}>
              {headerGroup.headers.map((header) => {
                return (
                  <TableHead key={header.id}>
                    {header.isPlaceholder
                      ? null
                      : flexRender(
                          header.column.columnDef.header,
                          header.getContext()
                        )}
                  </TableHead>
                )
              })}
            </TableRow>
          ))}
        </TableHeader>
        <TableBody>
          {table.getRowModel().rows?.length ? (
            table.getRowModel().rows.map((row) => (
              <TableRow
                key={row.id}
                data-state={row.getIsSelected() && "selected"}
              >
                {row.getVisibleCells().map((cell) => (
                  <TableCell key={cell.id}>
                    {flexRender(cell.column.columnDef.cell, cell.getContext())}
                  </TableCell>
                ))}
              </TableRow>
            ))
          ) : (
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell colSpan={columns.length} className="h-24 text-center">
                No results.
              </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          )}
        </TableBody>
      </Table>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Callout>

**Tip**: If you find yourself using `<DataTable />` in multiple places, this is the component you could make reusable by extracting it to `components/ui/data-table.tsx`.

`<DataTable columns={columns} data={data} />`

</Callout>

### Render the table

Finally, we'll render our table in our page component.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/page.tsx" {22}
import { columns, Payment } from "./columns"
import { DataTable } from "./data-table"

async function getData(): Promise<Payment[]> {
  // Fetch data from your API here.
  return [
    {
      id: "728ed52f",
      amount: 100,
      status: "pending",
      email: "m@example.com",
    },
    // ...
  ]
}

export default async function DemoPage() {
  const data = await getData()

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-10">
      <DataTable columns={columns} data={data} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>

## Cell Formatting

Let's format the amount cell to display the dollar amount. We'll also align the cell to the right.

<Steps>

### Update columns definition

Update the `header` and `cell` definitions for amount as follows:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/columns.tsx" {4-15}
export const columns: ColumnDef<Payment>[] = [
  {
    accessorKey: "amount",
    header: () => <div className="text-right">Amount</div>,
    cell: ({ row }) => {
      const amount = parseFloat(row.getValue("amount"))
      const formatted = new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
        style: "currency",
        currency: "USD",
      }).format(amount)

      return <div className="text-right font-medium">{formatted}</div>
    },
  },
]
```

You can use the same approach to format other cells and headers.

</Steps>

## Row Actions

Let's add row actions to our table. We'll use a `<Dropdown />` component for this.

<Steps>

### Update columns definition

Update our columns definition to add a new `actions` column. The `actions` cell returns a `<Dropdown />` component.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/columns.tsx" {4,6-14,18-45}
"use client"

import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"
import { MoreHorizontal } from "lucide-react"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuLabel,
  DropdownMenuSeparator,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu"

export const columns: ColumnDef<Payment>[] = [
  // ...
  {
    id: "actions",
    cell: ({ row }) => {
      const payment = row.original

      return (
        <DropdownMenu>
          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
            <Button variant="ghost" className="h-8 w-8 p-0">
              <span className="sr-only">Open menu</span>
              <MoreHorizontal className="h-4 w-4" />
            </Button>
          </DropdownMenuTrigger>
          <DropdownMenuContent align="end">
            <DropdownMenuLabel>Actions</DropdownMenuLabel>
            <DropdownMenuItem
              onClick={() => navigator.clipboard.writeText(payment.id)}
            >
              Copy payment ID
            </DropdownMenuItem>
            <DropdownMenuSeparator />
            <DropdownMenuItem>View customer</DropdownMenuItem>
            <DropdownMenuItem>View payment details</DropdownMenuItem>
          </DropdownMenuContent>
        </DropdownMenu>
      )
    },
  },
  // ...
]
```

You can access the row data using `row.original` in the `cell` function. Use this to handle actions for your row eg. use the `id` to make a DELETE call to your API.

</Steps>

## Pagination

Next, we'll add pagination to our table.

<Steps>

### Update `<DataTable>`

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" {5,17}
import {
  ColumnDef,
  flexRender,
  getCoreRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  useReactTable,
} from "@tanstack/react-table"

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
  })

  // ...
}
```

This will automatically paginate your rows into pages of 10. See the [pagination docs](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/features/pagination) for more information on customizing page size and implementing manual pagination.

### Add pagination controls

We can add pagination controls to our table using the `<Button />` component and the `table.previousPage()`, `table.nextPage()` API methods.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" {1,15,21-39}
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="rounded-md border">
        <Table>
          { // .... }
        </Table>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-end space-x-2 py-4">
        <Button
          variant="outline"
          size="sm"
          onClick={() => table.previousPage()}
          disabled={!table.getCanPreviousPage()}
        >
          Previous
        </Button>
        <Button
          variant="outline"
          size="sm"
          onClick={() => table.nextPage()}
          disabled={!table.getCanNextPage()}
        >
          Next
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

See [Reusable Components](#reusable-components) section for a more advanced pagination component.

</Steps>

## Sorting

Let's make the email column sortable.

<Steps>

### Update `<DataTable>`

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" showLineNumbers {3,6,10,18,25-28}
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import {
  ColumnDef,
  SortingState,
  flexRender,
  getCoreRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  getSortedRowModel,
  useReactTable,
} from "@tanstack/react-table"

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState<SortingState>([])

  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
    onSortingChange: setSorting,
    getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
    state: {
      sorting,
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="rounded-md border">
        <Table>{ ... }</Table>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Make header cell sortable

We can now update the `email` header cell to add sorting controls.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/columns.tsx" {4,9-19}
"use client"

import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"
import { ArrowUpDown } from "lucide-react"

export const columns: ColumnDef<Payment>[] = [
  {
    accessorKey: "email",
    header: ({ column }) => {
      return (
        <Button
          variant="ghost"
          onClick={() => column.toggleSorting(column.getIsSorted() === "asc")}
        >
          Email
          <ArrowUpDown className="ml-2 h-4 w-4" />
        </Button>
      )
    },
  },
]
```

This will automatically sort the table (asc and desc) when the user toggles on the header cell.

</Steps>

## Filtering

Let's add a search input to filter emails in our table.

<Steps>

### Update `<DataTable>`

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" {6,10,17,24-26,35-36,39,45-54}
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import {
  ColumnDef,
  ColumnFiltersState,
  SortingState,
  flexRender,
  getCoreRowModel,
  getFilteredRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  getSortedRowModel,
  useReactTable,
} from "@tanstack/react-table"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState<SortingState>([])
  const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = React.useState<ColumnFiltersState>(
    []
  )

  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    onSortingChange: setSorting,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
    getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
    onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters,
    getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
    state: {
      sorting,
      columnFilters,
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="flex items-center py-4">
        <Input
          placeholder="Filter emails..."
          value={(table.getColumn("email")?.getFilterValue() as string) ?? ""}
          onChange={(event) =>
            table.getColumn("email")?.setFilterValue(event.target.value)
          }
          className="max-w-sm"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="rounded-md border">
        <Table>{ ... }</Table>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Filtering is now enabled for the `email` column. You can add filters to other columns as well. See the [filtering docs](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/filters) for more information on customizing filters.

</Steps>

## Visibility

Adding column visibility is fairly simple using `@tanstack/react-table` visibility API.

<Steps>

### Update `<DataTable>`

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" {8,18-23,33-34,45,49,64-91}
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import {
  ColumnDef,
  ColumnFiltersState,
  SortingState,
  VisibilityState,
  flexRender,
  getCoreRowModel,
  getFilteredRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  getSortedRowModel,
  useReactTable,
} from "@tanstack/react-table"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuCheckboxItem,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu"

export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState<SortingState>([])
  const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = React.useState<ColumnFiltersState>(
    []
  )
  const [columnVisibility, setColumnVisibility] =
    React.useState<VisibilityState>({})

  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    onSortingChange: setSorting,
    onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
    getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
    getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
    onColumnVisibilityChange: setColumnVisibility,
    state: {
      sorting,
      columnFilters,
      columnVisibility,
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="flex items-center py-4">
        <Input
          placeholder="Filter emails..."
          value={table.getColumn("email")?.getFilterValue() as string}
          onChange={(event) =>
            table.getColumn("email")?.setFilterValue(event.target.value)
          }
          className="max-w-sm"
        />
        <DropdownMenu>
          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
            <Button variant="outline" className="ml-auto">
              Columns
            </Button>
          </DropdownMenuTrigger>
          <DropdownMenuContent align="end">
            {table
              .getAllColumns()
              .filter(
                (column) => column.getCanHide()
              )
              .map((column) => {
                return (
                  <DropdownMenuCheckboxItem
                    key={column.id}
                    className="capitalize"
                    checked={column.getIsVisible()}
                    onCheckedChange={(value) =>
                      column.toggleVisibility(!!value)
                    }
                  >
                    {column.id}
                  </DropdownMenuCheckboxItem>
                )
              })}
          </DropdownMenuContent>
        </DropdownMenu>
      </div>
      <div className="rounded-md border">
        <Table>{ ... }</Table>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This adds a dropdown menu that you can use to toggle column visibility.

</Steps>

## Row Selection

Next, we're going to add row selection to our table.

<Steps>

### Update column definitions

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/columns.tsx" {6,9-27}
"use client"

import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"

import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"
import { Checkbox } from "@/components/ui/checkbox"

export const columns: ColumnDef<Payment>[] = [
  {
    id: "select",
    header: ({ table }) => (
      <Checkbox
        checked={
          table.getIsAllPageRowsSelected() ||
          (table.getIsSomePageRowsSelected() && "indeterminate")
        }
        onCheckedChange={(value) => table.toggleAllPageRowsSelected(!!value)}
        aria-label="Select all"
      />
    ),
    cell: ({ row }) => (
      <Checkbox
        checked={row.getIsSelected()}
        onCheckedChange={(value) => row.toggleSelected(!!value)}
        aria-label="Select row"
      />
    ),
    enableSorting: false,
    enableHiding: false,
  },
]
```

### Update `<DataTable>`

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/payments/data-table.tsx" {11,23,28}
export function DataTable<TData, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState<SortingState>([])
  const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = React.useState<ColumnFiltersState>(
    []
  )
  const [columnVisibility, setColumnVisibility] =
    React.useState<VisibilityState>({})
  const [rowSelection, setRowSelection] = React.useState({})

  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    onSortingChange: setSorting,
    onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
    getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
    getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
    onColumnVisibilityChange: setColumnVisibility,
    onRowSelectionChange: setRowSelection,
    state: {
      sorting,
      columnFilters,
      columnVisibility,
      rowSelection,
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="rounded-md border">
        <Table />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This adds a checkbox to each row and a checkbox in the header to select all rows.

### Show selected rows

You can show the number of selected rows using the `table.getFilteredSelectedRowModel()` API.

```tsx
<div className="text-muted-foreground flex-1 text-sm">
  {table.getFilteredSelectedRowModel().rows.length} of{" "}
  {table.getFilteredRowModel().rows.length} row(s) selected.
</div>
```

</Steps>

## Reusable Components

Here are some components you can use to build your data tables. This is from the [Tasks](/examples/tasks) demo.

### Column header

Make any column header sortable and hideable.

<ComponentSource
  src="/app/(app)/examples/tasks/components/data-table-column-header.tsx"
  title="components/data-table-column-header.tsx"
/>

```tsx showLineNumbers {5}
export const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: "email",
    header: ({ column }) => (
      <DataTableColumnHeader column={column} title="Email" />
    ),
  },
]
```

### Pagination

Add pagination controls to your table including page size and selection count.

<ComponentSource src="/app/(app)/examples/tasks/components/data-table-pagination.tsx" />

```tsx
<DataTablePagination table={table} />
```

### Column toggle

A component to toggle column visibility.

<ComponentSource src="/app/(app)/examples/tasks/components/data-table-view-options.tsx" />

```tsx
<DataTableViewOptions table={table} />
```

title: React Hook Form
description: Building forms with React Hook Form and Zod.
links:
  doc: https://react-hook-form.com
---

Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

In this guide, we will take a look at building forms with [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [`zod`](https://zod.dev). We're going to use a `<FormField>` component to compose accessible forms using Radix UI components.

## Features

The `<Form />` component is a wrapper around the `react-hook-form` library. It provides a few things:

- Composable components for building forms.
- A `<FormField />` component for building controlled form fields.
- Form validation using `zod`.
- Handles accessibility and error messages.
- Uses `React.useId()` for generating unique IDs.
- Applies the correct `aria` attributes to form fields based on states.
- Built to work with all Radix UI components.
- Bring your own schema library. We use `zod` but you can use anything you want.
- **You have full control over the markup and styling.**

## Anatomy

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Form>
  <FormField
    control={...}
    name="..."
    render={() => (
      <FormItem>
        <FormLabel />
        <FormControl>
          { /* Your form field */}
        </FormControl>
        <FormDescription />
        <FormMessage />
      </FormItem>
    )}
  />
</Form>
```

## Example

```tsx showLineNumbers
const form = useForm()

<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="username"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input placeholder="shadcn" {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormDescription>This is your public display name.</FormDescription>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

</CodeTabs>

## Usage

<Steps>

### Create a form schema

Define the shape of your form using a Zod schema. You can read more about using Zod in the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev).

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/example-form.tsx" {3,5-7}
"use client"

import { z } from "zod"

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2).max(50),
})
```

### Define a form

Use the `useForm` hook from `react-hook-form` to create a form.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/example-form.tsx" {3-4,14-20,22-27}
"use client"

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { z } from "zod"

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: "Username must be at least 2 characters.",
  }),
})

export function ProfileForm() {
  // 1. Define your form.
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
    },
  })

  // 2. Define a submit handler.
  function onSubmit(values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
    // Do something with the form values.
    // ✅ This will be type-safe and validated.
    console.log(values)
  }
}
```

Since `FormField` is using a controlled component, you need to provide a default value for the field. See the [React Hook Form docs](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/usecontroller) to learn more about controlled components.

### Build your form

We can now use the `<Form />` components to build our form.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/example-form.tsx" {7-17,28-50}
"use client"

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { z } from "zod"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormDescription,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: "Username must be at least 2 characters.",
  }),
})

export function ProfileForm() {
  // ...

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-8">
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name="username"
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder="shadcn" {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormDescription>
                This is your public display name.
              </FormDescription>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

### Done

That's it. You now have a fully accessible form that is type-safe with client-side validation.

<ComponentPreview
  name="input-form"
  className="[&_[role=tablist]]:hidden [&>div>div:first-child]:hidden"
/>

>
  <InputOTPGroup>
    <InputOTPSlot index={0} />
    {/* ... */}
  </InputOTPGroup>
</InputOTP>
```

## Changelog

### 2024-03-19 Composition

We've made some updates and replaced the render props pattern with composition. Here's how to update your code if you prefer the composition pattern.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** You are not required to update your code if you are using the
  `render` prop. It is still supported.
</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>Update to the latest version of `input-otp`.</Step>

```bash
npm install input-otp@latest
```

<Step>Update `input-otp.tsx`</Step>

```diff showLineNumbers title="input-otp.tsx" {2,8-11}
- import { OTPInput, SlotProps } from "input-otp"
+ import { OTPInput, OTPInputContext } from "input-otp"

 const InputOTPSlot = React.forwardRef<
   React.ElementRef<"div">,
-   SlotProps & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">
-  >(({ char, hasFakeCaret, isActive, className, ...props }, ref) => {
+   React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div"> & { index: number }
+  >(({ index, className, ...props }, ref) => {
+   const inputOTPContext = React.useContext(OTPInputContext)
+   const { char, hasFakeCaret, isActive } = inputOTPContext.slots[index]
```

<Step>Then replace the `render` prop in your code.</Step>

```diff showLineNumbers {2-12}
<InputOTP maxLength={6}>
  <InputOTPGroup>
    <InputOTPSlot index={0} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={1} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={2} />
  </InputOTPGroup>
  <InputOTPSeparator />
  <InputOTPGroup>
    <InputOTPSlot index={3} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={4} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={5} />
  </InputOTPGroup>
</InputOTP>
```

</Steps>

### 2024-03-19 Disabled

To add a disabled state to the input, update `<InputOTP />` as follows:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="input-otp.tsx" {4,7-11}
const InputOTP = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof OTPInput>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof OTPInput>
>(({ className, containerClassName, ...props }, ref) => (
  <OTPInput
    ref={ref}
    containerClassName={cn(
      "flex items-center gap-2 has-[:disabled]:opacity-50",
      containerClassName
    )}
    className={cn("disabled:cursor-not-allowed", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
InputOTP.displayName = "InputOTP"
```

```

### Next.js

By default the `<PaginationLink />` component will render an `<a />` tag.

To use the Next.js `<Link />` component, make the following updates to `pagination.tsx`.

```diff showLineNumbers /typeof Link/ {1}
+ import Link from "next/link"

- type PaginationLinkProps = ... & React.ComponentProps<"a">
+ type PaginationLinkProps = ... & React.ComponentProps<typeof Link>

const PaginationLink = ({...props }: ) => (
  <PaginationItem>
-   <a>
+   <Link>
      // ...
-   </a>
+   </Link>
  </PaginationItem>
)

```

  Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving
  jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the
  royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester. And
  then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by
  Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they
  started laughing, they couldn't stop.

Sidebars are one of the most complex components to build. They are central
to any application and often contain a lot of moving parts.

I don't like building sidebars. So I built 30+ of them. All kinds of
configurations. Then I extracted the core components into `sidebar.tsx`.

We now have a solid foundation to build on top of. Composable. Themeable.
Customizable.

## Structure

A `Sidebar` component is composed of the following parts:

- `SidebarProvider` - Handles collapsible state.
- `Sidebar` - The sidebar container.
- `SidebarHeader` and `SidebarFooter` - Sticky at the top and bottom of the sidebar.
- `SidebarContent` - Scrollable content.
- `SidebarGroup` - Section within the `SidebarContent`.
- `SidebarTrigger` - Trigger for the `Sidebar`.

## Usage

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/layout.tsx"
import { SidebarProvider, SidebarTrigger } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"
import { AppSidebar } from "@/components/app-sidebar"

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <AppSidebar />
      <main>
        <SidebarTrigger />
        {children}
      </main>
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/app-sidebar.tsx"
import {
  Sidebar,
  SidebarContent,
  SidebarFooter,
  SidebarGroup,
  SidebarHeader,
} from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarHeader />
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup />
        <SidebarGroup />
      </SidebarContent>
      <SidebarFooter />
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

## Your First Sidebar

Let's start with the most basic sidebar. A collapsible sidebar with a menu.

<Steps>

<Step>
  Add a `SidebarProvider` and `SidebarTrigger` at the root of your application.
</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/layout.tsx"
import { SidebarProvider, SidebarTrigger } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"
import { AppSidebar } from "@/components/app-sidebar"

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <AppSidebar />
      <main>
        <SidebarTrigger />
        {children}
      </main>
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}
```

<Step>Create a new sidebar component at `components/app-sidebar.tsx`.</Step>

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/app-sidebar.tsx"
import { Sidebar, SidebarContent } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent />
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

<Step>Now, let's add a `SidebarMenu` to the sidebar.</Step>

We'll use the `SidebarMenu` component in a `SidebarGroup`.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/app-sidebar.tsx"
import { Calendar, Home, Inbox, Search, Settings } from "lucide-react"

import {
  Sidebar,
  SidebarContent,
  SidebarGroup,
  SidebarGroupContent,
  SidebarGroupLabel,
  SidebarMenu,
  SidebarMenuButton,
  SidebarMenuItem,
} from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

// Menu items.
const items = [
  {
    title: "Home",
    url: "#",
    icon: Home,
  },
  {
    title: "Inbox",
    url: "#",
    icon: Inbox,
  },
  {
    title: "Calendar",
    url: "#",
    icon: Calendar,
  },
  {
    title: "Search",
    url: "#",
    icon: Search,
  },
  {
    title: "Settings",
    url: "#",
    icon: Settings,
  },
]

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup>
          <SidebarGroupLabel>Application</SidebarGroupLabel>
          <SidebarGroupContent>
            <SidebarMenu>
              {items.map((item) => (
                <SidebarMenuItem key={item.title}>
                  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
                    <a href={item.url}>
                      <item.icon />
                      <span>{item.title}</span>
                    </a>
                  </SidebarMenuButton>
                </SidebarMenuItem>
              ))}
            </SidebarMenu>
          </SidebarGroupContent>
        </SidebarGroup>
      </SidebarContent>
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

<Step>You've created your first sidebar.</Step>

You should see something like this:

<figure className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-demo"
    title="Sidebar"
    type="block"
    description="Your first sidebar."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    Your first sidebar.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

</Steps>

## Components

The components in `sidebar.tsx` are built to be composable i.e you build your sidebar by putting the provided components together. They also compose well with other shadcn/ui components such as `DropdownMenu`, `Collapsible` or `Dialog` etc.

**If you need to change the code in `sidebar.tsx`, you are encouraged to do so. The code is yours. Use `sidebar.tsx` as a starting point and build your own.**

In the next sections, we'll go over each component and how to use them.

## SidebarProvider

The `SidebarProvider` component is used to provide the sidebar context to the `Sidebar` component. You should always wrap your application in a `SidebarProvider` component.

### Props

| Name           | Type                      | Description                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultOpen`  | `boolean`                 | Default open state of the sidebar.           |
| `open`         | `boolean`                 | Open state of the sidebar (controlled).      |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` | Sets open state of the sidebar (controlled). |

### Width

If you have a single sidebar in your application, you can use the `SIDEBAR_WIDTH` and `SIDEBAR_WIDTH_MOBILE` variables in `sidebar.tsx` to set the width of the sidebar.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/ui/sidebar.tsx"
const SIDEBAR_WIDTH = "16rem"
const SIDEBAR_WIDTH_MOBILE = "18rem"
```

For multiple sidebars in your application, you can use the `style` prop to set the width of the sidebar.

To set the width of the sidebar, you can use the `--sidebar-width` and `--sidebar-width-mobile` CSS variables in the `style` prop.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/ui/sidebar.tsx"
<SidebarProvider
  style={{
    "--sidebar-width": "20rem",
    "--sidebar-width-mobile": "20rem",
  }}
>
  <Sidebar />
</SidebarProvider>
```

This will handle the width of the sidebar but also the layout spacing.

### Keyboard Shortcut

The `SIDEBAR_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT` variable is used to set the keyboard shortcut used to open and close the sidebar.

To trigger the sidebar, you use the `cmd+b` keyboard shortcut on Mac and `ctrl+b` on Windows.

You can change the keyboard shortcut by updating the `SIDEBAR_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT` variable.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/ui/sidebar.tsx"
const SIDEBAR_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT = "b"
```

### Persisted State

The `SidebarProvider` supports persisting the sidebar state across page reloads and server-side rendering. It uses cookies to store the current state of the sidebar. When the sidebar state changes, a default cookie named `sidebar_state` is set with the current open/closed state. This cookie is then read on subsequent page loads to restore the sidebar state.

To persist sidebar state in Next.js, set up your `SidebarProvider` in `app/layout.tsx` like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/layout.tsx"
import { cookies } from "next/headers"

import { SidebarProvider, SidebarTrigger } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"
import { AppSidebar } from "@/components/app-sidebar"

export async function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  const defaultOpen = cookieStore.get("sidebar_state")?.value === "true"

  return (
    <SidebarProvider defaultOpen={defaultOpen}>
      <AppSidebar />
      <main>
        <SidebarTrigger />
        {children}
      </main>
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}
```

You can change the name of the cookie by updating the `SIDEBAR_COOKIE_NAME` variable in `sidebar.tsx`.

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/ui/sidebar.tsx"
const SIDEBAR_COOKIE_NAME = "sidebar_state"
```

## Sidebar

The main `Sidebar` component used to render a collapsible sidebar.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return <Sidebar />
}
```

### Props

| Property      | Type                              | Description                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `side`        | `left` or `right`                 | The side of the sidebar.          |
| `variant`     | `sidebar`, `floating`, or `inset` | The variant of the sidebar.       |
| `collapsible` | `offcanvas`, `icon`, or `none`    | Collapsible state of the sidebar. |

### side

Use the `side` prop to change the side of the sidebar.

Available options are `left` and `right`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return <Sidebar side="left | right" />
}
```

### variant

Use the `variant` prop to change the variant of the sidebar.

Available options are `sidebar`, `floating` and `inset`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return <Sidebar variant="sidebar | floating | inset" />
}
```

<Callout>
  **Note:** If you use the `inset` variant, remember to wrap your main content
  in a `SidebarInset` component.
</Callout>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarProvider>
  <Sidebar variant="inset" />
  <SidebarInset>
    <main>{children}</main>
  </SidebarInset>
</SidebarProvider>
```

### collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to make the sidebar collapsible.

Available options are `offcanvas`, `icon` and `none`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return <Sidebar collapsible="offcanvas | icon | none" />
}
```

| Prop        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `offcanvas` | A collapsible sidebar that slides in from the left or right. |
| `icon`      | A sidebar that collapses to icons.                           |
| `none`      | A non-collapsible sidebar.                                   |

## useSidebar

The `useSidebar` hook is used to control the sidebar.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useSidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  const {
    state,
    open,
    setOpen,
    openMobile,
    setOpenMobile,
    isMobile,
    toggleSidebar,
  } = useSidebar()
}
```

| Property        | Type                      | Description                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `state`         | `expanded` or `collapsed` | The current state of the sidebar.             |
| `open`          | `boolean`                 | Whether the sidebar is open.                  |
| `setOpen`       | `(open: boolean) => void` | Sets the open state of the sidebar.           |
| `openMobile`    | `boolean`                 | Whether the sidebar is open on mobile.        |
| `setOpenMobile` | `(open: boolean) => void` | Sets the open state of the sidebar on mobile. |
| `isMobile`      | `boolean`                 | Whether the sidebar is on mobile.             |
| `toggleSidebar` | `() => void`              | Toggles the sidebar. Desktop and mobile.      |

## SidebarHeader

Use the `SidebarHeader` component to add a sticky header to the sidebar.

The following example adds a `<DropdownMenu>` to the `SidebarHeader`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-header"
    title="Sidebar"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar header with a dropdown menu."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar header with a dropdown menu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/app-sidebar.tsx"
<Sidebar>
  <SidebarHeader>
    <SidebarMenu>
      <SidebarMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenu>
          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
            <SidebarMenuButton>
              Select Workspace
              <ChevronDown className="ml-auto" />
            </SidebarMenuButton>
          </DropdownMenuTrigger>
          <DropdownMenuContent className="w-[--radix-popper-anchor-width]">
            <DropdownMenuItem>
              <span>Acme Inc</span>
            </DropdownMenuItem>
            <DropdownMenuItem>
              <span>Acme Corp.</span>
            </DropdownMenuItem>
          </DropdownMenuContent>
        </DropdownMenu>
      </SidebarMenuItem>
    </SidebarMenu>
  </SidebarHeader>
</Sidebar>
```

## SidebarFooter

Use the `SidebarFooter` component to add a sticky footer to the sidebar.

The following example adds a `<DropdownMenu>` to the `SidebarFooter`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-footer"
    title="Sidebar"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar footer with a dropdown menu."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar footer with a dropdown menu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers title="components/app-sidebar.tsx"
export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <Sidebar>
        <SidebarHeader />
        <SidebarContent />
        <SidebarFooter>
          <SidebarMenu>
            <SidebarMenuItem>
              <DropdownMenu>
                <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
                  <SidebarMenuButton>
                    <User2 /> Username
                    <ChevronUp className="ml-auto" />
                  </SidebarMenuButton>
                </DropdownMenuTrigger>
                <DropdownMenuContent
                  side="top"
                  className="w-[--radix-popper-anchor-width]"
                >
                  <DropdownMenuItem>
                    <span>Account</span>
                  </DropdownMenuItem>
                  <DropdownMenuItem>
                    <span>Billing</span>
                  </DropdownMenuItem>
                  <DropdownMenuItem>
                    <span>Sign out</span>
                  </DropdownMenuItem>
                </DropdownMenuContent>
              </DropdownMenu>
            </SidebarMenuItem>
          </SidebarMenu>
        </SidebarFooter>
      </Sidebar>
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}
```

## SidebarContent

The `SidebarContent` component is used to wrap the content of the sidebar. This is where you add your `SidebarGroup` components. It is scrollable.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar, SidebarContent } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup />
        <SidebarGroup />
      </SidebarContent>
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

## SidebarGroup

Use the `SidebarGroup` component to create a section within the sidebar.

A `SidebarGroup` has a `SidebarGroupLabel`, a `SidebarGroupContent` and an optional `SidebarGroupAction`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-group"
    title="Sidebar Group"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar group."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar group.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Sidebar, SidebarContent, SidebarGroup } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup>
          <SidebarGroupLabel>Application</SidebarGroupLabel>
          <SidebarGroupAction>
            <Plus /> <span className="sr-only">Add Project</span>
          </SidebarGroupAction>
          <SidebarGroupContent></SidebarGroupContent>
        </SidebarGroup>
      </SidebarContent>
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

## Collapsible SidebarGroup

To make a `SidebarGroup` collapsible, wrap it in a `Collapsible`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-group-collapsible"
    title="Sidebar Group"
    type="block"
    description="A collapsible sidebar group."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A collapsible sidebar group.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Collapsible defaultOpen className="group/collapsible">
      <SidebarGroup>
        <SidebarGroupLabel asChild>
          <CollapsibleTrigger>
            Help
            <ChevronDown className="ml-auto transition-transform group-data-[state=open]/collapsible:rotate-180" />
          </CollapsibleTrigger>
        </SidebarGroupLabel>
        <CollapsibleContent>
          <SidebarGroupContent />
        </CollapsibleContent>
      </SidebarGroup>
    </Collapsible>
  )
}
```

<Callout>
  **Note:** We wrap the `CollapsibleTrigger` in a `SidebarGroupLabel` to render
  a button.
</Callout>

## SidebarGroupAction

Use the `SidebarGroupAction` component to add an action button to the `SidebarGroup`.

<figure className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-group-action"
    title="Sidebar Group"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar group with an action button."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar group with an action button.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers {5-7}
export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <SidebarGroup>
      <SidebarGroupLabel asChild>Projects</SidebarGroupLabel>
      <SidebarGroupAction title="Add Project">
        <Plus /> <span className="sr-only">Add Project</span>
      </SidebarGroupAction>
      <SidebarGroupContent />
    </SidebarGroup>
  )
}
```

## SidebarMenu

The `SidebarMenu` component is used for building a menu within a `SidebarGroup`.

A `SidebarMenu` component is composed of `SidebarMenuItem`, `SidebarMenuButton`, `<SidebarMenuAction />` and `<SidebarMenuSub />` components.

<Image
  src="/images/sidebar-menu.png"
  width="716"
  height="420"
  alt="Sidebar Menu"
  className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
/>
<Image
  src="/images/sidebar-menu-dark.png"
  width="716"
  height="420"
  alt="Sidebar Menu"
  className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:block"
/>

Here's an example of a `SidebarMenu` component rendering a list of projects.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-menu"
    title="Sidebar Menu"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar menu with a list of projects."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar menu with a list of projects.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Sidebar>
  <SidebarContent>
    <SidebarGroup>
      <SidebarGroupLabel>Projects</SidebarGroupLabel>
      <SidebarGroupContent>
        <SidebarMenu>
          {projects.map((project) => (
            <SidebarMenuItem key={project.name}>
              <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
                <a href={project.url}>
                  <project.icon />
                  <span>{project.name}</span>
                </a>
              </SidebarMenuButton>
            </SidebarMenuItem>
          ))}
        </SidebarMenu>
      </SidebarGroupContent>
    </SidebarGroup>
  </SidebarContent>
</Sidebar>
```

## SidebarMenuButton

The `SidebarMenuButton` component is used to render a menu button within a `SidebarMenuItem`.

### Link or Anchor

By default, the `SidebarMenuButton` renders a button but you can use the `asChild` prop to render a different component such as a `Link` or an `a` tag.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuButton asChild>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
</SidebarMenuButton>
```

### Icon and Label

You can render an icon and a truncated label inside the button. Remember to wrap the label in a `<span>`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuButton asChild>
  <a href="#">
    <Home />
    <span>Home</span>
  </a>
</SidebarMenuButton>
```

### isActive

Use the `isActive` prop to mark a menu item as active.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuButton asChild isActive>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
</SidebarMenuButton>
```

## SidebarMenuAction

The `SidebarMenuAction` component is used to render a menu action within a `SidebarMenuItem`.

This button works independently of the `SidebarMenuButton` i.e you can have the `<SidebarMenuButton />` as a clickable link and the `<SidebarMenuAction />` as a button.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
    <a href="#">
      <Home />
      <span>Home</span>
    </a>
  </SidebarMenuButton>
  <SidebarMenuAction>
    <Plus /> <span className="sr-only">Add Project</span>
  </SidebarMenuAction>
</SidebarMenuItem>
```

### DropdownMenu

Here's an example of a `SidebarMenuAction` component rendering a `DropdownMenu`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-menu-action"
    title="Sidebar Menu Action"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar menu action with a dropdown menu."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar menu action with a dropdown menu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
    <a href="#">
      <Home />
      <span>Home</span>
    </a>
  </SidebarMenuButton>
  <DropdownMenu>
    <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
      <SidebarMenuAction>
        <MoreHorizontal />
      </SidebarMenuAction>
    </DropdownMenuTrigger>
    <DropdownMenuContent side="right" align="start">
      <DropdownMenuItem>
        <span>Edit Project</span>
      </DropdownMenuItem>
      <DropdownMenuItem>
        <span>Delete Project</span>
      </DropdownMenuItem>
    </DropdownMenuContent>
  </DropdownMenu>
</SidebarMenuItem>
```

## SidebarMenuSub

The `SidebarMenuSub` component is used to render a submenu within a `SidebarMenu`.

Use `<SidebarMenuSubItem />` and `<SidebarMenuSubButton />` to render a submenu item.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-menu-sub"
    title="Sidebar Menu Sub"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar menu sub."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar menu with a submenu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton />
  <SidebarMenuSub>
    <SidebarMenuSubItem>
      <SidebarMenuSubButton />
    </SidebarMenuSubItem>
    <SidebarMenuSubItem>
      <SidebarMenuSubButton />
    </SidebarMenuSubItem>
  </SidebarMenuSub>
</SidebarMenuItem>
```

## Collapsible SidebarMenu

To make a `SidebarMenu` component collapsible, wrap it and the `SidebarMenuSub` components in a `Collapsible`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-menu-collapsible"
    title="Sidebar Menu"
    type="block"
    description="A collapsible sidebar menu."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A collapsible sidebar menu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenu>
  <Collapsible defaultOpen className="group/collapsible">
    <SidebarMenuItem>
      <CollapsibleTrigger asChild>
        <SidebarMenuButton />
      </CollapsibleTrigger>
      <CollapsibleContent>
        <SidebarMenuSub>
          <SidebarMenuSubItem />
        </SidebarMenuSub>
      </CollapsibleContent>
    </SidebarMenuItem>
  </Collapsible>
</SidebarMenu>
```

## SidebarMenuBadge

The `SidebarMenuBadge` component is used to render a badge within a `SidebarMenuItem`.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-menu-badge"
    title="Sidebar Menu Badge"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar menu badge."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar menu with a badge.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton />
  <SidebarMenuBadge>24</SidebarMenuBadge>
</SidebarMenuItem>
```

## SidebarMenuSkeleton

The `SidebarMenuSkeleton` component is used to render a skeleton for a `SidebarMenu`. You can use this to show a loading state when using React Server Components, SWR or react-query.

```tsx showLineNumbers
function NavProjectsSkeleton() {
  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={index}>
          <SidebarMenuSkeleton />
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}
```

## SidebarSeparator

The `SidebarSeparator` component is used to render a separator within a `Sidebar`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Sidebar>
  <SidebarHeader />
  <SidebarSeparator />
  <SidebarContent>
    <SidebarGroup />
    <SidebarSeparator />
    <SidebarGroup />
  </SidebarContent>
</Sidebar>
```

## SidebarTrigger

Use the `SidebarTrigger` component to render a button that toggles the sidebar.

The `SidebarTrigger` component must be used within a `SidebarProvider`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<SidebarProvider>
  <Sidebar />
  <main>
    <SidebarTrigger />
  </main>
</SidebarProvider>
```

### Custom Trigger

To create a custom trigger, you can use the `useSidebar` hook.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useSidebar } from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

export function CustomTrigger() {
  const { toggleSidebar } = useSidebar()

  return <button onClick={toggleSidebar}>Toggle Sidebar</button>
}
```

## SidebarRail

The `SidebarRail` component is used to render a rail within a `Sidebar`. This rail can be used to toggle the sidebar.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Sidebar>
  <SidebarHeader />
  <SidebarContent>
    <SidebarGroup />
  </SidebarContent>
  <SidebarFooter />
  <SidebarRail />
</Sidebar>
```

## Data Fetching

### React Server Components

Here's an example of a `SidebarMenu` component rendering a list of projects using React Server Components.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-rsc"
    title="Sidebar Menu RSC"
    type="block"
    description="A sidebar menu using React Server Components."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A sidebar menu using React Server Components.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers {6} title="Skeleton to show loading state."
function NavProjectsSkeleton() {
  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={index}>
          <SidebarMenuSkeleton showIcon />
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers {2} title="Server component fetching data."
async function NavProjects() {
  const projects = await fetchProjects()

  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {projects.map((project) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={project.name}>
          <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
            <a href={project.url}>
              <project.icon />
              <span>{project.name}</span>
            </a>
          </SidebarMenuButton>
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers {8-10} title="Usage with React Suspense."
function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup>
          <SidebarGroupLabel>Projects</SidebarGroupLabel>
          <SidebarGroupContent>
            <React.Suspense fallback={<NavProjectsSkeleton />}>
              <NavProjects />
            </React.Suspense>
          </SidebarGroupContent>
        </SidebarGroup>
      </SidebarContent>
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

### SWR and React Query

You can use the same approach with [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

```tsx showLineNumbers title="SWR"
function NavProjects() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useSWR("/api/projects", fetcher)

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <SidebarMenu>
        {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
          <SidebarMenuItem key={index}>
            <SidebarMenuSkeleton showIcon />
          </SidebarMenuItem>
        ))}
      </SidebarMenu>
    )
  }

  if (!data) {
    return ...
  }

  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {data.map((project) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={project.name}>
          <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
            <a href={project.url}>
              <project.icon />
              <span>{project.name}</span>
            </a>
          </SidebarMenuButton>
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers title="React Query"
function NavProjects() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery()

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <SidebarMenu>
        {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
          <SidebarMenuItem key={index}>
            <SidebarMenuSkeleton showIcon />
          </SidebarMenuItem>
        ))}
      </SidebarMenu>
    )
  }

  if (!data) {
    return ...
  }

  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {data.map((project) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={project.name}>
          <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
            <a href={project.url}>
              <project.icon />
              <span>{project.name}</span>
            </a>
          </SidebarMenuButton>
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}
```

## Controlled Sidebar

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control the sidebar.

<figure className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-4">
  <ComponentPreview
    name="sidebar-controlled"
    title="Sidebar Controlled"
    type="block"
    description="A controlled sidebar."
    className="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">
    A controlled sidebar.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```tsx showLineNumbers
export function AppSidebar() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <SidebarProvider open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <Sidebar />
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}
```

## Theming

We use the following CSS variables to theme the sidebar.

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --sidebar-background: 0 0% 98%;
    --sidebar-foreground: 240 5.3% 26.1%;
    --sidebar-primary: 240 5.9% 10%;
    --sidebar-primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;
    --sidebar-accent: 240 4.8% 95.9%;
    --sidebar-accent-foreground: 240 5.9% 10%;
    --sidebar-border: 220 13% 91%;
    --sidebar-ring: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;
  }

  .dark {
    --sidebar-background: 240 5.9% 10%;
    --sidebar-foreground: 240 4.8% 95.9%;
    --sidebar-primary: 0 0% 98%;
    --sidebar-primary-foreground: 240 5.9% 10%;
    --sidebar-accent: 240 3.7% 15.9%;
    --sidebar-accent-foreground: 240 4.8% 95.9%;
    --sidebar-border: 240 3.7% 15.9%;
    --sidebar-ring: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;
  }
}
```

**We intentionally use different variables for the sidebar and the rest of the application** to make it easy to have a sidebar that is styled differently from the rest of the application. Think a sidebar with a darker shade from the main application.

## Styling

Here are some tips for styling the sidebar based on different states.

- **Styling an element based on the sidebar collapsible state.** The following will hide the `SidebarGroup` when the sidebar is in `icon` mode.

```tsx
<Sidebar collapsible="icon">
  <SidebarContent>
    <SidebarGroup className="group-data-[collapsible=icon]:hidden" />
  </SidebarContent>
</Sidebar>
```

- **Styling a menu action based on the menu button active state.** The following will force the menu action to be visible when the menu button is active.

```tsx
<SidebarMenuItem>
  <SidebarMenuButton />
  <SidebarMenuAction className="peer-data-[active=true]/menu-button:opacity-100" />
</SidebarMenuItem>
```

You can find more tips on using states for styling in this [Twitter thread](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1842329158879420864).

## Changelog

### 2024-10-30 Cookie handling in setOpen

- [#5593](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/5593) - Improved setOpen callback logic in `<SidebarProvider>`.

Update the `setOpen` callback in `<SidebarProvider>` as follows:

```tsx showLineNumbers
const setOpen = React.useCallback(
  (value: boolean | ((value: boolean) => boolean)) => {
    const openState = typeof value === "function" ? value(open) : value
    if (setOpenProp) {
      setOpenProp(openState)
    } else {
      _setOpen(openState)
    }

    // This sets the cookie to keep the sidebar state.
    document.cookie = `${SIDEBAR_COOKIE_NAME}=${openState}; path=/; max-age=${SIDEBAR_COOKIE_MAX_AGE}`
  },
  [setOpenProp, open]

## Data Table

You can use the `<Table />` component to build more complex data tables. Combine it with [@tanstack/react-table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) to create tables with sorting, filtering and pagination.

See the [Data Table](/docs/components/data-table) documentation for more information.

You can also see an example of a data table in the [Tasks](/examples/tasks) demo.

<Steps>

## Install next-themes

Start by installing `next-themes`:

```bash
npm install next-themes
```

## Create a theme provider

```tsx title="components/theme-provider.tsx" showLineNumbers
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider as NextThemesProvider } from "next-themes"

export function ThemeProvider({
  children,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof NextThemesProvider>) {
  return <NextThemesProvider {...props}>{children}</NextThemesProvider>
}
```

## Wrap your root layout

Add the `ThemeProvider` to your root layout and add the `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to the `html` tag.

```tsx {1,6,9-14,16} title="app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
        <head />
        <body>
          <ThemeProvider
            attribute="class"
            defaultTheme="system"
            enableSystem
            disableTransitionOnChange
          >
            {children}
          </ThemeProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Add a mode toggle

Place a mode toggle on your site to toggle between light and dark mode.

<ComponentPreview name="mode-toggle" className="[&_.preview]:items-start" />

</Steps>

description: Adding dark mode to your remix app.
---

<Steps>

## Modify your tailwind.css file

Add `:root[class~="dark"]` to your tailwind.css file. This will allow you to use the `dark` class on your html element to apply dark mode styles.

```css {2} title="app/tailwind.css" showLineNumbers
.dark,
:root[class~="dark"] {
  ...;
}
```

## Install remix-themes

Start by installing `remix-themes`:

```bash
npm install remix-themes
```

## Create a session storage and theme session resolver

```tsx title="app/sessions.server.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { createThemeSessionResolver } from "remix-themes"

// You can default to 'development' if process.env.NODE_ENV is not set
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"

const sessionStorage = createCookieSessionStorage({
  cookie: {
    name: "theme",
    path: "/",
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: "lax",
    secrets: ["s3cr3t"],
    // Set domain and secure only if in production
    ...(isProduction
      ? { domain: "your-production-domain.com", secure: true }
      : {}),
  },
})

export const themeSessionResolver = createThemeSessionResolver(sessionStorage)
```

## Set up Remix Themes

Add the `ThemeProvider` to your root layout.

```tsx {1-3,6-11,15-22,25-26,28,33} title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers
import clsx from "clsx"
import { PreventFlashOnWrongTheme, ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "remix-themes"

import { themeSessionResolver } from "./sessions.server"

// Return the theme from the session storage using the loader
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const { getTheme } = await themeSessionResolver(request)
  return {
    theme: getTheme(),
  }
}
// Wrap your app with ThemeProvider.
// `specifiedTheme` is the stored theme in the session storage.
// `themeAction` is the action name that's used to change the theme in the session storage.
export default function AppWithProviders() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
  return (
    <ThemeProvider specifiedTheme={data.theme} themeAction="/action/set-theme">
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export function App() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
  const [theme] = useTheme()
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={clsx(theme)}>
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <Meta />
        <PreventFlashOnWrongTheme ssrTheme={Boolean(data.theme)} />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Add an action route

Create a file in `/routes/action.set-theme.ts`. Ensure that you pass the filename to the ThemeProvider component. This route it's used to store the preferred theme in the session storage when the user changes it.

```tsx title="app/routes/action.set-theme.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createThemeAction } from "remix-themes"

import { themeSessionResolver } from "./sessions.server"

export const action = createThemeAction(themeSessionResolver)
```

## Add a mode toggle

Place a mode toggle on your site to toggle between light and dark mode.

```tsx title="components/mode-toggle.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react"
import { Theme, useTheme } from "remix-themes"

import { Button } from "./ui/button"
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "./ui/dropdown-menu"

export function ModeToggle() {
  const [, setTheme] = useTheme()

  return (
    <DropdownMenu>
      <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <Sun className="h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] scale-100 rotate-0 transition-all dark:scale-0 dark:-rotate-90" />
          <Moon className="absolute h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] scale-0 rotate-90 transition-all dark:scale-100 dark:rotate-0" />
          <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
        </Button>
      </DropdownMenuTrigger>
      <DropdownMenuContent align="end">
        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme(Theme.LIGHT)}>
          Light
        </DropdownMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme(Theme.DARK)}>
          Dark
        </DropdownMenuItem>
      </DropdownMenuContent>
    </DropdownMenu>
  )
}
```

## Create a theme provider

```tsx title="components/theme-provider.tsx"
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react"

type Theme = "dark" | "light" | "system"

type ThemeProviderProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode
  defaultTheme?: Theme
  storageKey?: string
}

type ThemeProviderState = {
  theme: Theme
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void
}

const initialState: ThemeProviderState = {
  theme: "system",
  setTheme: () => null,
}

const ThemeProviderContext = createContext<ThemeProviderState>(initialState)

export function ThemeProvider({
  children,
  defaultTheme = "system",
  storageKey = "vite-ui-theme",
  ...props
}: ThemeProviderProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(
    () => (localStorage.getItem(storageKey) as Theme) || defaultTheme
  )

  useEffect(() => {
    const root = window.document.documentElement

    root.classList.remove("light", "dark")

    if (theme === "system") {
      const systemTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
        .matches
        ? "dark"
        : "light"

      root.classList.add(systemTheme)
      return
    }

    root.classList.add(theme)
  }, [theme])

  const value = {
    theme,
    setTheme: (theme: Theme) => {
      localStorage.setItem(storageKey, theme)
      setTheme(theme)
    },
  }

  return (
    <ThemeProviderContext.Provider {...props} value={value}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProviderContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeProviderContext)

  if (context === undefined)
    throw new Error("useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider")

  return context
}
```

## Wrap your root layout

Add the `ThemeProvider` to your root layout.

```tsx {1,5-7} title="App.tsx"
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark" storageKey="vite-ui-theme">
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Add a mode toggle

Place a mode toggle on your site to toggle between light and dark mode.

```tsx title="components/mode-toggle.tsx"
import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu"
import { useTheme } from "@/components/theme-provider"

export function ModeToggle() {
  const { setTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <DropdownMenu>
      <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="outline" size="icon">
          <Sun className="h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] scale-100 rotate-0 transition-all dark:scale-0 dark:-rotate-90" />
          <Moon className="absolute h-[1.2rem] w-[1.2rem] scale-0 rotate-90 transition-all dark:scale-100 dark:rotate-0" />
          <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
        </Button>
      </DropdownMenuTrigger>
      <DropdownMenuContent align="end">

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Astro project:

```bash
npx create-astro@latest astro-app  --template with-tailwindcss --install --add react --git
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts title="tsconfig.json" {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Add Components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {2,16} showLineNumbers
---
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
---

  **Update:** We have added full support for React 19 and Tailwind v4 in the
  `canary` release. See the docs for [Tailwind v4](/docs/tailwind-v4) for more
  information.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Gatsby project using `create-gatsby`:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

### Configure your Gatsby project to use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

You will be asked a few questions to configure your project:

```txt showLineNumbers
✔ What would you like to call your site?
· your-app-name
✔ What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created?
· your-app-name
✔ Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript?
· TypeScript
✔ Will you be using a CMS?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Would you like to install a styling system?
· Tailwind CSS
✔ Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Shall we do this? (Y/n) · Yes
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Create gatsby-node.ts file

Create a `gatsby-node.ts` file at the root of your project if it doesn’t already exist, and add the code below to the `gatsby-node` file so your app can resolve paths:

```ts
import * as path from "path"

export const onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        "@/components": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/components"),
        "@/lib/utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/lib/utils"),
      },
    },
  })
}
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › ./src/styles/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Laravel project with Inertia and React using the laravel installer `laravel new my-app`:

```bash
laravel new my-app --react
```

### Add Components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add switch
```

The command above will add the `Switch` component to `resources/js/components/ui/switch.tsx`. You can then import it like this:

```tsx title="resources/js/pages/index.tsx" {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Switch } from "@/components/ui/switch"

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Switch />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyPage
```

title: Manual Installation
description: Add dependencies to your project manually.
---

<Steps>

### Add Tailwind CSS

Components are styled using Tailwind CSS. You need to install Tailwind CSS in your project.

[Follow the Tailwind CSS installation instructions to get started.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

### Add dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your project:

```bash
npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css
```

### Configure path aliases

Configure the path aliases in your `tsconfig.json` file.

```json {3-6} title="tsconfig.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `@` alias is a preference. You can use other aliases if you want.

### Configure styles

Add the following to your styles/globals.css file. You can learn more about using CSS variables for theming in the [theming section](/docs/theming).

<CodeCollapsibleWrapper>

```css showLineNumbers title="src/styles/globals.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";

@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));

### Add a cn helper

```ts showLineNumbers title="lib/utils.ts"
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

### Create a `components.json` file

Create a `components.json` file in the root of your project.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": true,
    "prefix": ""
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",

    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"
}
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

<Callout>

**Note:** This guide is for Remix. For React Router, see the [React Router](/docs/installation/react-router) guide.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Remix project using `create-remix`:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest my-app
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```bash
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Neutral
```

### App structure

<Callout>

**Note**: This app structure is only a suggestion. You can place the files wherever you want.

</Callout>

- Place the UI components in the `app/components/ui` folder.
- Your own components can be placed in the `app/components` folder.
- The `app/lib` folder contains all the utility functions. We have a `utils.ts` where we define the `cn` helper.
- The `app/tailwind.css` file contains the global CSS.

### Install Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

Then we create a `postcss.config.js` file:

```js title="postcss.config.js" showLineNumbers
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

And finally we add the following to our `remix.config.js` file:

```js title="remix.config.js" {4-5} showLineNumbers
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
export default {
  ...
  tailwind: true,
  postcss: true,
  ...
};
```

### Add `tailwind.css` to your app

In your `app/root.tsx` file, import the `tailwind.css` file:

```js {1, 4} showLineNumbers title="app/root.tsx"
import styles from "./tailwind.css?url"

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: styles },
  ...(cssBundleHref ? [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: cssBundleHref }] : []),
]
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers title="app/routes/index.tsx"
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new TanStack Start project by following the [Build a Project from Scratch](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/build-from-scratch) guide on the TanStack Start website.

**Do not add Tailwind yet. We'll install Tailwind v4 in the next step.**

### Add Tailwind

Install `tailwindcss` and its dependencies.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

### Create postcss.config.ts

Create a `postcss.config.ts` file at the root of your project.

```ts title="postcss.config.ts" showLineNumbers
export default {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
}
```

### Create `app/styles/app.css`

Create an `app.css` file in the `app/styles` directory and import `tailwindcss`

```css title="app/styles/app.css"
@import "tailwindcss" source("../");
```

### Import `app.css`

```tsx title="app/routes/__root.tsx" showLineNumbers {5,21-26} showLineNumbers
import type { ReactNode } from "react"
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router"
import { Meta, Scripts } from "@tanstack/start"

import appCss from "@/styles/app.css?url"

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
    links: [
      {
        rel: "stylesheet",
        href: appCss,
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
})
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths.

```ts title="tsconfig.json" showLineNumbers {9-12}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./app/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@canary init
```

This will create a `components.json` file in the root of your project and configure CSS variables inside `app/styles/app.css`.

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@canary add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx title="app/routes/index.tsx" showLineNumbers {1,6}
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const state = Route.useLoaderData()

  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---
title: Vite
description: Install and configure shadcn/ui for Vite.
---

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new React project using `vite`. Select the **React + TypeScript** template:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

### Add Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

Replace everything in `src/index.css` with the following:

```css title="src/index.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

The current version of Vite splits TypeScript configuration into three files, two of which need to be edited.
Add the `baseUrl` and `paths` properties to the `compilerOptions` section of the `tsconfig.json` and
`tsconfig.app.json` files:

```ts title="tsconfig.json" {11-16} showLineNumbers
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.app.json"
    },
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.node.json"
    }
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Edit tsconfig.app.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.app.json` file to resolve paths, for your IDE:

```ts title="tsconfig.app.json" {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Update vite.config.ts

Add the following code to the vite.config.ts so your app can resolve paths without error:

```bash
npm install -D @types/node
```

```typescript title="vite.config.ts" showLineNumbers {1,2,8-13}
import path from "path"
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
})
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`.

```txt
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Neutral
```

### Add Components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="src/App.tsx"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-svh flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## registry:style

### Custom style that extends shadcn/ui

The following registry item is a custom style that extends shadcn/ui. On `npx shadcn init`, it will:

- Install `@tabler/icons-react` as a dependency.
- Add the `login-01` block and `calendar` component to the project.
- Add the `editor` from a remote registry.
- Set the `font-sans` variable to `Inter, sans-serif`.
- Install a `brand` color in light and dark mode.

```json title="example-style.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "example-style",
  "type": "registry:style",
  "dependencies": ["@tabler/icons-react"],

    }
  }
}
```

### Custom style from scratch

The following registry item is a custom style that doesn't extend shadcn/ui. See the `extends: none` field.

It can be used to create a new style from scratch i.e custom components, css vars, dependencies, etc.

On `npx shadcn add`, the following will:

- Install `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` as dependencies.
- Add the `utils` registry item from the shadcn/ui registry.
- Add the `button`, `input`, `label`, and `select` components from a remote registry.
- Install new css vars: `main`, `bg`, `border`, `text`, `ring`.

## Add custom utilities

### Simple utility

```json title="example-component.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "custom-component",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "css": {
    "@utility content-auto": {
      "content-visibility": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

### Complex utility

```json title="example-utility.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "custom-component",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "css": {
    "@utility scrollbar-hidden": {
      "scrollbar-hidden": {
        "&::-webkit-scrollbar": {
          "display": "none"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Functional utilities

```json title="example-functional.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "custom-component",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "css": {
    "@utility tab-*": {
      "tab-size": "var(--tab-size-*)"
    }
  }
}
```

## Add custom animations

Note: you need to define both `@keyframes` in css and `theme` in cssVars to use animations.

```json title="example-component.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "custom-component",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "cssVars": {
    "theme": {
      "--animate-wiggle": "wiggle 1s ease-in-out infinite"
    }
  },
  "css": {
    "@keyframes wiggle": {
      "0%, 100%": {
        "transform": "rotate(-3deg)"
      },
      "50%": {
        "transform": "rotate(3deg)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Frequently asked questions

### What does a complex component look like?

Here's an example of a complex component that installs a page, two components, a hook, a format-date utils and a config file.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "hello-world",
  "title": "Hello World",
  "type": "registry:block",
  "description": "A complex hello world component",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/page.tsx",
      "type": "registry:page",
      "target": "app/hello/page.tsx"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/components/hello-world.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/components/formatted-message.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/hooks/use-hello.ts",
      "type": "registry:hook"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/lib/format-date.ts",
      "type": "registry:utils"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/hello.config.ts",
      "type": "registry:file",
      "target": "~/hello.config.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### How do I add a new Tailwind color?

To add a new color you need to add it to `cssVars` under `light` and `dark` keys.

```json showLineNumbers {10-18}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "hello-world",
  "title": "Hello World",
  "type": "registry:block",
  "description": "A complex hello world component",
  "files": [
    // ...
  ],
  "cssVars": {
    "light": {
      "brand-background": "20 14.3% 4.1%",
      "brand-accent": "20 14.3% 4.1%"
    },
    "dark": {
      "brand-background": "20 14.3% 4.1%",
      "brand-accent": "20 14.3% 4.1%"
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI will update the project CSS file. Once updated, the new colors will be available to be used as utility classes: `bg-brand` and `text-brand-accent`.

### How do I add or override a Tailwind theme variable?

To add or override a theme variable you add it to `cssVars.theme` under the key you want to add or override.

```json showLineNumbers {10-15}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
  "name": "hello-world",
  "title": "Hello World",
  "type": "registry:block",
  "description": "A complex hello world component",
  "files": [
    // ...
  ],
  "cssVars": {
    "theme": {
      "text-base": "3rem",
      "ease-in-out": "cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)",
      "font-heading": "Poppins, sans-serif"
    }
  }
}
```

title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to get setup and run your own component registry.
---

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own component registry.

It assumes you already have a project with components and would like to turn it into a registry.

If you're starting a new registry project, you can use the [registry template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/registry-template) as a starting point. We have already configured it for you.

## registry.json

The `registry.json` file is only required if you're using the `shadcn` CLI to build your registry.

If you're using a different build system, you can skip this step as long as your build system produces valid JSON files that conform to the [registry-item schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-item-json).

<Steps>

### Add a registry.json file

Create a `registry.json` file in the root of your project. Your project can be a Next.js, Remix, Vite, or any other project that supports React.

```json title="registry.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json",
  "name": "acme",
  "homepage": "https://acme.com",
  "items": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

This `registry.json` file must conform to the [registry schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-json).

</Steps>

## Add a registry item

<Steps>

### Create your component

Add your first component. Here's an example of a simple `<HelloWorld />` component:

```tsx title="registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function HelloWorld() {
  return <Button>Hello World</Button>
}
```

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** This example places the component in the `registry/new-york`
  directory. You can place it anywhere in your project as long as you set the
  correct path in the `registry.json` file and you follow the `registry/[NAME]`
  directory structure.
</Callout>

```txt
registry
└── new-york
    └── hello-world
        └── hello-world.tsx
```

### Add your component to the registry

To add your component to the registry, you need to add your component definition to `registry.json`.

```json title="registry.json" showLineNumbers {6-17}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json",
  "name": "acme",
  "homepage": "https://acme.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "hello-world",
      "type": "registry:block",
      "title": "Hello World",
      "description": "A simple hello world component.",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world.tsx",
          "type": "registry:component"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You define your registry item by adding a `name`, `type`, `title`, `description` and `files`.

For every file you add, you must specify the `path` and `type` of the file. The `path` is the relative path to the file from the root of your project. The `type` is the type of the file.

You can read more about the registry item schema and file types in the [registry item schema docs](/docs/registry/registry-item-json).

</Steps>

## Build your registry

<Steps>

### Install the shadcn CLI

Note: the `build` command is currently only available in the `shadcn@canary` version of the CLI.

```bash
npm install shadcn@canary
```

### Add a build script

Add a `registry:build` script to your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "registry:build": "shadcn build"
  }
}
```

### Run the build script

Run the build script to generate the registry JSON files.

```bash
npm run registry:build
```

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** By default, the build script will generate the registry JSON files
  in `public/r` e.g `public/r/hello-world.json`.

You can change the output directory by passing the `--output` option. See the [shadcn build command](/docs/cli#build) for more information.

</Callout>

</Steps>

## Serve your registry

If you're running your registry on Next.js, you can now serve your registry by running the `next` server. The command might differ for other frameworks.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your files will now be served at `http://localhost:3000/r/[NAME].json` eg. `http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json`.

## Publish your registry

To make your registry available to other developers, you can publish it by deploying your project to a public URL.

## Adding Auth

The `shadcn` CLI does not offer a built-in way to add auth to your registry. We recommend handling authorization on your registry server.

A common simple approach is to use a `token` query parameter to authenticate requests to your registry. e.g. `http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json?token=[SECURE_TOKEN_HERE]`.

Use the secure token to authenticate requests and return a 401 Unauthorized response if the token is invalid. Both the `shadcn` CLI and `Open in v0` will handle the 401 response and display a message to the user.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** Make sure to encrypt and expire tokens.
</Callout>

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when building components for a registry.

- Place your registry item in the `registry/[STYLE]/[NAME]` directory. I'm using `new-york` as an example. It can be anything you want as long as it's nested under the `registry` directory.
- The following properties are required for the block definition: `name`, `description`, `type` and `files`.
- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in `registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg. `input`, `button`, `card`, etc or a URL to a registry item eg. `http://localhost:3000/r/editor.json`.
- Make sure to list all dependencies in `dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg. `zod`, `sonner`, etc. To set a version, you can use the `name@version` format eg. `zod@^3.20.0`.
- **Imports should always use the `@/registry` path.** eg. `import { HelloWorld } from "@/registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world"`
- Ideally, place your files within a registry item in `components`, `hooks`, `lib` directories.

## Install using the CLI

To install a registry item using the `shadcn` CLI, use the `add` command followed by the URL of the registry item.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json
```

Registry items are automatically compatible with the `shadcn` CLI and `Open in v0`.

## Requirements

You are free to design and host your custom registry as you see fit. The only requirement is that your registry items must be valid JSON files that conform to the [registry-item schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-item-json).

If you'd like to see an example of a registry, we have a [template project](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/registry-template) for you to use as a starting point.

title: Open in v0
description: Integrate your registry with Open in v0.
---

If your registry is hosted and publicly accessible via a URL, you can open a registry item in v0 by using the `https://v0.dev/chat/api/open?url=[URL]` endpoint.

eg. [https://v0.dev/chat/api/open?url=https://ui.shadcn.com/r/styles/new-york/login-01.json](https://v0.dev/chat/api/open?url=https://ui.shadcn.com/r/styles/new-york/login-01.json)

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** The `Open in v0` button does not support `cssVars` and `tailwind`
  properties.
</Callout>

## Button

See [Build your Open in v0 button](https://v0.dev/chat/button) for more information on how to build your own `Open in v0` button.

Here's a simple example of how to add a `Open in v0` button to your site.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function OpenInV0Button({ url }: { url: string }) {
  return (
    <Button

</div>

## Definitions

You can see the JSON Schema for `registry-item.json` [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json).

### $schema

The `$schema` property is used to specify the schema for the `registry-item.json` file.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json"
}
```

### name

The name of the item. This is used to identify the item in the registry. It should be unique for your registry.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "hello-world"
}
```

### title

A human-readable title for your registry item. Keep it short and descriptive.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Hello World"
}
```

### description

A description of your registry item. This can be longer and more detailed than the `title`.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "description": "A simple hello world component."
}
```

### type

The `type` property is used to specify the type of your registry item. This is used to determine the type and target path of the item when resolved for a project.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "type": "registry:block"
}
```

The following types are supported:

| Type                 | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `registry:block`     | Use for complex components with multiple files.  |
| `registry:component` | Use for simple components.                       |
| `registry:lib`       | Use for lib and utils.                           |
| `registry:hook`      | Use for hooks.                                   |
| `registry:ui`        | Use for UI components and single-file primitives |
| `registry:page`      | Use for page or file-based routes.               |
| `registry:file`      | Use for miscellaneous files.                     |
| `registry:style`     | Use for registry styles. eg. `new-york`          |
| `registry:theme`     | Use for themes.                                  |

### author

The `author` property is used to specify the author of the registry item.

It can be unique to the registry item or the same as the author of the registry.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "author": "John Doe <john@doe.com>"
}
```

### dependencies

The `dependencies` property is used to specify the dependencies of your registry item. This is for `npm` packages.

Use `@version` to specify the version of your registry item.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "dependencies": [
    "@radix-ui/react-accordion",
    "zod",
    "lucide-react",
    "name@1.0.2"
  ]
}
```

### registryDependencies

Used for registry dependencies. Can be names or URLs. Use the name of the item to reference shadcn/ui components and urls to reference other registries.

- For `shadcn/ui` registry items such as `button`, `input`, `select`, etc use the name eg. `['button', 'input', 'select']`.
- For custom registry items use the URL of the registry item eg. `['https://example.com/r/hello-world.json']`.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "registryDependencies": [
    "button",
    "input",
    "select",
    "https://example.com/r/editor.json"
  ]
}
```

Note: The CLI will automatically resolve remote registry dependencies.

### files

The `files` property is used to specify the files of your registry item. Each file has a `path`, `type` and `target` (optional) property.

**The `target` property is required for `registry:page` and `registry:file` types.**

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/page.tsx",
      "type": "registry:page",
      "target": "app/hello/page.tsx"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/use-hello-world.ts",
      "type": "registry:hook"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/hello-world/.env",
      "type": "registry:file",
      "target": "~/.env"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### path

The `path` property is used to specify the path to the file in your registry. This path is used by the build script to parse, transform and build the registry JSON payload.

#### type

The `type` property is used to specify the type of the file. See the [type](#type) section for more information.

#### target

The `target` property is used to indicate where the file should be placed in a project. This is optional and only required for `registry:page` and `registry:file` types.

By default, the `shadcn` cli will read a project's `components.json` file to determine the target path. For some files, such as routes or config you can specify the target path manually.

Use `~` to refer to the root of the project e.g `~/foo.config.js`.

### tailwind

**DEPRECATED:** Use `cssVars.theme` instead for Tailwind v4 projects.

The `tailwind` property is used for tailwind configuration such as `theme`, `plugins` and `content`.

You can use the `tailwind.config` property to add colors, animations and plugins to your registry item.

```json title="registry-item.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": {
      "theme": {
        "extend": {
          "colors": {
            "brand": "hsl(var(--brand))"
          },
          "keyframes": {

          "type": "registry:component"
