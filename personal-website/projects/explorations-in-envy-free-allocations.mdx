The goal of this project is to find optimally fair allocations of divisible and non-divisible goods for a group of people under three different definitions of fairness under envy-freeness with certain assumptions. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations are created in AMPL and solved using CPLEX resulting in the generation of datasets consisting of the minimal approximate envy value and solver elapsed time for different combinations of number of people and number of goods. Interactive 3D visualizations of this dataset are created in Python and analysis of results is conducted. The project consists of two main outcomes, `paper.pdf`, which is a full, compiled research paper, and `report_nb.ipynb` which hosts the results datasets and visualizations.

Fair division problems are a significant class of problems with considerable multidisciplinary involvement ranging from social science to computer science. Currently there exist many specificies of envy-freeness, applied to a multitude of scenarios, solved through assorted methodologies. To guide the work in this project, three particular definitions of envy-freeness are analyzed for a particular situation. These are envy-freeness, envy-freeness up to one item, and envy-freeness with the inclusion of a divisible subsidy in the form of a cash amount. We apply these definitions to the situation where items are indivisible and valuations are both additive and normalized.

These three definitions were modeled in the AMPL programming language and then solved using the IBM CPLEX solver for two simple examples and a collection of generated data for different combinations of number of people and number of items to be allocated.

The results for the two simple examples serve to validate the accuracy of the formulationsa nd the results for the collection of generated data allow for analysis to be conducted on the complexity of these problem types. Furthermore, strategies are devised and implemented to reduce the runtime of the envy-freeness instance including: upper-bounding the objective function, initializing CPLEX with a feasible starting solution, the combination of both upper-bounding the objective function and initializing CPLEX with a feasible starting solution, and finally tuning various CPLEX parameters.
