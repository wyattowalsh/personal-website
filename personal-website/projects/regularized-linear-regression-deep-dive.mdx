title: "Regularized Linear Regression Deep Dive"
description: "Explanations and Python implementations of Ordinary Least Squares regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression (solved via Coordinate Descent), and Elastic Net regression (also solved via Coordinate Descent) applied to assess wine quality given numerous numerical features. Additional data analysis and visualization in Python is included."

This project consists of a deep dive on multiple linear regression (OLS) and its regularized variants (Ridge, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net) as well as Python implementations for exploratory data analysis, K-Fold cross-validation and modeling functions as applied to regression of a wine quality dataset. This examination applies optimization theory to either derive model estimator (for OLS and Ridge) or derive the update rule for Pathwise Coordinate Descent (the discrete optimization algorithm chosen and implemented to solve the Lasso and the Elastic Net). These derivations have accompanying Python implementations, which are leveraged to predict wine quality ratings within a supervised learning context.
